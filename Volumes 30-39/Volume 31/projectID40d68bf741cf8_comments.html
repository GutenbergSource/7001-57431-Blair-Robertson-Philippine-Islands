<HTML><BODY><h2>The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898</h2>

<p>When the Americans took over the Philippines, they took no half measures in documenting themselves. One of the results is the 55-volume work, <i>The Philippine Islands</i> by Blair and Robertson. In this work, a large number of source documents related to the Philippines are translated to English and provided with valuable annotations. Some contain sometimes boring documents, but there are plenty of real gems as well. I will be releasing all of these volumes to PGDP one-by-one. (Except for volumes XV and a part of XVI, which are already in PG as <i>History of the Philippine Islands</i> by Antonio de Morga, etext number 7001; and volumes LIV and LV, the analytical index, nearly 1000 pages in extremely small print, which adds little value to a e-text which allows easy full-text searching.)

<h3>General instructions</h3>

<p>I will be creating XML, HTML and text versions of this work, hence some of the instructions below will differ from the standard instructions in a few small points.

<p>When proofing, please leave the references to page numbers intact. I will convert them to hyperlinks.

<p>Please do not fix any errors that are present in the original. Especially where we are dealing with transcriptions of old manuscripts, where any error might be purposely copied from the manuscript by the editor, and want to leave this intact. For the same reason, leave the long esses (which look like an f, or, in this edition almost as a forward slash /) in the text. You can encode them with /s or /f. If you think something is a typo, please mark it with a *. Similarly, leave v, vv, and u exactly as they are in the source (and verify that the OCR software did not automatically 'correct' them somehow).

<p>A few works contain alternating pages with on one page the source language (mostly Spanish, but sometimes Italian), and on the facing page the English translation. I will try to indicate this in the individual projects. If you don't like working on Spanish or Italian, just return such pages to the round.

<p>In some places, these works include odd characters and scribal abbreviations. I will try to collect a list of these here, but if you notice one I've missed, please tell me about it. Please transcribe them as indicated.

<table width=100%>
<tr><td><b>Special character</b>	
<td><b>Description</b>									
<td><b>Encoding</b>
<tr><td>					<td>f without bar (long s)						<td>/f
<tr><td>					<td>p with bar through descender (<i>par</i>)	<td>/p
<tr><td>					<td>q with tilde (<i>que</i>)					<td>~q
</table>

<p>Superior (raised) characters are to be encoded like this: A^o 1859; 3^{rd}.

<p>Inferior (lowered) characters are to be encoded like this H_{2}O.
