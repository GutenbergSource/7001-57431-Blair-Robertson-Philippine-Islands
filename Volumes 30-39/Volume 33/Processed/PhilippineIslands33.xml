 <milestone unit="tb"/>

 </p><p>With the present volume is begun the publication of Antonio Pigafetta&#8217;s relation of the first circumnavigation of the world&#8212;the greatest single achievement in all the history of sea exploration and discovery. Written by a participant of the expedition, Pigafetta&#8217;s relation has a greater value than any other narrative of the voyage. Its great value and the fact that it has never been adequately presented to the English-speaking public have induced the editors to insert this relation in the present series both in the original Italian (rigidly adhering to and preserving all the peculiarities of the original manuscript) and in English translation. This relation is especially valuable for its descriptions of the various peoples, countries, and products, of Oriental seas, and for its vocabularies, as well as for its account of the first circumnavigation. From its very nature, the relation has called for an unusual amount of <pb id="pb12" n="12"/>annotation, which has been drawn freely from various sources: chiefly Mosto&#8217;s annotations in his publication of Pigafetta&#8217;s relation in Part V, volume iii, of the <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">Raccolta di documenti e studi</hi>, published by the Royal Columbian Commission of the fourth centenary of the discovery of America under the auspices of the Minister of Public Instruction (Roma, 1894); Navarrete&#8217;s <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Col. de viages</hi>, iv (Madrid, 1837); various publications of the Hakluyt Society; and F. H. H. Guillemard&#8217;s <hi>Life of Ferdinand Magellan</hi> (New York, 1891). The publication of the original Italian and the English, page for page, renders it necessary to place the annotations at the end of the volume instead of in footnote as hitherto. The various charts of the Italian manuscript are all presented in facsimile in the course of the work. In order that the various peculiarities of the manuscript might be preserved, it has been necessary to specially design and cast certain characters that appear in Pigafetta&#8217;s narrative. None of these characters have been reproduced by Mosto, who also writes out all abbreviations. Throughout we have aimed to present the document as it exists in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana (even to the spacing of words) with the exception that paragraphs in the manuscript begin with a hanging indention and usually end with a series of dots and dashes. A brief synopsis of the relation follows.

 </p><p>After a brief dedication to the grand master of the Hospitaler knights of Rhodes or Malta, as they were called later, and of which order he is a member, Pigafetta relates that, being at Barcelona in 1519 with the papal legate, he first hears of the expedition about to set out under Magalh&#227;es. Being <pb id="pb13" n="13"/>desirous of seeing the world, he gains permission to accompany the expedition, and soon joins the fleet at Seville, whence it is to depart. Magalh&#227;es, as a wise commander, issues his instructions to the various commanders of the vessels ere port is left, so that they may keep together in the unknown seas before them, and that they may act in harmony.

 </p><p>Setting sail from Seville on August 10, 1519, the fleet of five small vessels starts on its long journey amid salvos of artillery. At the mouth of the Guadalquivir, San Lucar de Barrameda, they anchor until September 20, when setting sail once more, they make for the Canaries, which are reached September 26. There they reprovision and taking their departure on October 3, coast southward along Africa amid alternating calms and violent storms (cheered however by the welcome apparition of St. Elmo&#8217;s fire, which promises them safety), until they cross the line. Thereupon taking a general westerly course, the cape of St. Augustine on the Brazilian coast is soon sighted. The fresh provisions, so essential to sea voyages, are procured on the coast of Brazil, where occurs the first communication with the natives, with whom wonderful bargains are made. Those Indians, cannibals though they be, and whom Pigafetta describes briefly (not failing to inscribe some of their language) receive the mariners hospitably, and thinking that the latter are come to remain among them, build them a house. But after a stay of eighteen days, the sails are again trimmed toward the south, and descending the coast, Magalh&#227;es anchors next at the Rio de la Plata which had formerly proved so disastrous to Juan de Solis and his men. Unable here to hold converse with the <pb id="pb14" n="14"/>anthropophagous natives, who flee at their approach, the fleet retakes its course, anchoring at two islands where many sea-wolves and penguins are taken, and thus fresh food obtained. The next anchorage is at the famous Bay of St. Julian along the desolate Patagonian coast, where for five months they winter. For two months not an individual is seen, but one day they gain their first sight of the Patagonians, whose huge bulk strikes all with surprise, and who are held as giants. Amicable relations are entered into with various of these wandering Indians, and finally Magalh&#227;es, with the taste for the wonderful that characterized his period, as strongly, or more strongly than our own, determines to capture two of them to take back to Spain as novelties. His ruse is successful, but an attempt to induce the wife of one of the Indians to go to the ship fails. Very interesting are these giants to the curious Pigafetta, and to him is due the earliest description of their manners and customs and the earliest specimens of their language. The two captured giants are placed in separate vessels, but unfortunately both die ere reaching the end of the journey, one in the deserting ship &#8220;San Antonio,&#8221; and the other in Magalh&#227;es&#8217;s own ship, the &#8220;Trinidad.&#8221;

 </p><p>During the five months at that port &#8220;many things happened there.&#8221; Shortly after entering the port, the most critical moment of all Magalh&#227;es&#8217;s life comes, and one which he has perhaps, dreaded from the beginning of the expedition. This is the mutiny headed by Juan de Cartagena, captain of one of the vessels, and other malcontents, who hate Magalh&#227;es because he is a Portuguese. The latter, however, proves equal to the emergency, and by his prompt <pb id="pb15" n="15"/>action and the punishments tempered by mercy that he inflicts, quiets the trouble. Jo&#227;o Serr&#227;o, captain of the &#8220;Santiago&#8221; is sent to explore the coast, but is shipwrecked, although all the crew are saved. Their rescue (not well told by Pigafetta) is a thrilling and arduous matter, and calls into play the endurance of men already tried by misfortune and buffetings with Nature.

 </p><p>With the fleet reduced to four vessels, the mariners leave port St. Julian and proceeding along the coast, anchor at the river of Sardines, where stormy weather threatens a disastrous end to the expedition. A stay of two months is made, during which the ships are enabled to lay in a good supply of provisions, wood, and water. Before leaving that river, the crews (for Magalh&#227;es looks after the spiritual welfare of his men) confess and take communion. Then resuming the voyage, the great object of the first half of the expedition is attained, namely, the discovery of the strait, which occurs October 21, 1520. &#8220;That strait is one hundred and ten leguas ... long, and it is one-half legua broad, more or less.&#8221; Its discovery is due to the indomitable energy and endurance of Magalh&#227;es, and his certain knowledge (probably overstated by Pigafetta) of its existence. Continuing, Pigafetta briefly narrates the passage through the strait, and the desertion of the &#8220;San Antonio,&#8221; which returns to Spain, after putting the captain, Alvaro de Mesquita, a relative of Magalh&#227;es, in irons; for the pilot, a Portuguese named Esteban Gomez, is jealous of Magalh&#227;es, as the latter&#8217;s expedition has destroyed ambitious plans of his own. The other three ships, leaving letters and signals in the strait, in case the &#8220;San Antonio&#8221; <pb id="pb16" n="16"/>tries to regain them, proceeds on its way, debouching from the strait November 28. Then begins a long voyage over the trackless Pacific &#8220;in truth ... very pacific;&#8221; and the three ships sail on steadily for three and two-thirds months without being able to reprovision. To the horrors of famine are added the sufferings of the dread scurvy. Pigafetta, whose curiosity is always alert and active, and who remains well, diverts himself with talking to the Patagonian, who is finally baptized, but who is one of those to die. In the vast stretch from the strait to the Ladrones (first seen by them of all Europeans), only two islands, both desert, are sighted, and those, since they are unable to find anchorage there, are called the &#8220;Unfortunate Isles.&#8221; Pigafetta mentions the southern constellation <hi>Crux</hi> and the star clouds since called after Magalh&#227;es. His geographical information, as one might expect, is not always accurate, for he places Cipangu (Japan) in the open Pacific. Thoughts of relief that come upon sighting various islands (which they called the Ladrones because of the thievishness of the inhabitants) are quickly dissipated by the hostility there encountered. So bold are these natives (whose appearance, life, and customs, Pigafetta describes briefly), that they even steal the ship&#8217;s boat from the stern of the &#8220;Trinidad,&#8221; thus necessitating a raid into one of the islands, where some of the natives are killed, and some houses burned, but the boat recovered.

 </p><p>On March 16, 1521, the first of the Philippines (by them called the archipelago of San Lazaro) to be seen by Europeans, is sighted. Anchor is cast at a small desert island called Humunu, (but which <pb id="pb17" n="17"/>the mariners call &#8220;The watering-place of good signs&#8221; because the first traces of gold are found there), near Samar, where two tents are quickly set up for the sick, whom Magalh&#227;es himself tends with solicitude. March 18, they gain their first acquaintance with the natives, who prove hospitable, and promise fresh provisions. These are brought on the twenty-second of March, and the Europeans have their first sight of a tattooed Visayan chief, who, as well as his men, is decked out in gold ornaments. After a week&#8217;s stay, the ships again set sail, Pigafetta almost coming to an untimely end by slipping over the side of the vessel while fishing, but happily saved by the aid of &#8220;that fount of mercy,&#8221; the Virgin.

 </p><p>March 28, anchor is cast at the island of Limasaua (Mazava), where Enrique, the Malaccan slave of Magalh&#227;es, serves as interpreter. Amicable relations are speedily entered into and confirmed by the Malayan rite of blood brotherhood. The king of Limasaua, and his brother, the king of certain districts in Mindanao, prove most helpful, and are completely won over by a judicious presentation of gifts. Greatly are the natives impressed by the power of the new comers, as seen in the artillery and armor, and their astonishment is increased when Magalh&#227;es relates his course to their islands and the discovery of the strait.

 </p><p>On Good Friday, Pigafetta and a companion visit the natives ashore, where they spend the night in the king&#8217;s palace, a typical Visayan house raised aloft on supports and thatched with nipa. Here the various ceremonies that he witnesses impress Pigafetta, and his companion, cast in coarser mould than he, becomes intoxicated. Pigafetta, always interested in <pb id="pb18" n="18"/>the language of the new peoples whom he meets, writes down certain of their words, whereat they are greatly astonished. He records that he &#8220;ate meat on Holy Friday, for I could not help myself.&#8221; On Easter Sunday, the natives are deeply impressed by the mass that is celebrated ashore, and the cross which is planted in the highest part of the island, and which they promise to adore.

 </p><p>The limited amount of food in Limasaua, which is used only as a place of recreation by the two kings, who go there to visit one another and hunt, leads Magalh&#227;es to seek a more abundant harbor. Among the places pointed out where food is abundant is the island of Ceb&#250;, and there Magalh&#227;es determines to go, &#8220;for so did his unhappy fate will.&#8221; After a seven days&#8217; stay at Limasaua, the course is laid to Ceb&#250; under the pilotage of the king of Limasaua, who is finally taken aboard the &#8220;Trinidad&#8221; as his vessel is unable to keep up with the swifter-moving European vessels. Entering the port of Ceb&#250; on April 7, amid the thunder of their guns, the settlement is thrown into consternation, but the Malaccan being sent ashore reassures them of his master&#8217;s good intentions, whom he proclaims to be a &#8220;captain of the greatest king and prince in the world,&#8221; who &#8220;was going to discover Malucho,&#8221; but hearing of the great fame of the king of Ceb&#250;, wishes trade with him. The king of Ceb&#250; is willing to accord friendship to the Europeans, but asks a tribute, as it is the custom for all visitors to pay it to him. But no tribute will be paid him, asserts Enrique, and the king, at the advice of a Moro merchant who has heard of the deeds of the Portuguese along Malacca and the Indian coast, and confuses the strangers with them, <pb id="pb19" n="19"/>until undeceived by Enrique (who declares them to be much greater than the Portuguese), expresses his willingness to make friendship with Magalh&#227;es. With the help of the friendly king of Limasaua, peace is made according to Malay rites, and gifts exchanged. Magalh&#227;es, deeply religious, in common with many of his age, early seeks to lure the natives of Ceb&#250; to holy baptism, by presenting to them its most attractive side, and promising the king if he becomes a Christian, a suit of armor; but they must become willing converts, and not for the hope of gain or for fear. The peace is more firmly cemented by the visit of Pigafetta and a companion to the king, where they witness ceremonies similar to those of Limasaua, and where gifts are bestowed upon the king and some others. They also visit the house of the prince apparent, where they hear their first concert of Visayan music and see a native dance. On the following Wednesday two of the crew are buried ashore on consecrated ground with as much pomp as possible.

 </p><p>Trading is instituted by carrying a quantity of merchandise ashore, the safety of which is assured by the king. Those people are found to have weights and measures for their trading; and besides their gongs, a flute-like instrument. Their houses are entered by ladders. On Friday begins the trading, gold being given for metals and large articles, and food for the smaller wares. The good bargains obtained by the Europeans, would have been materially less and the trade spoiled forever had it not been for Magalh&#227;es&#8217;s watchfulness, for so eager are the men at the sight of the gold, that they would have given almost anything for it. On the following Sunday, <pb id="pb20" n="20"/>the king and his chief men, and the queen and many women, are baptized and given European names, and ere the week closes all the Cebuans have become Christians, as well as some from neighboring islands. The queen at her earnest request, is given a small image of the Christ child, the same afterward recovered by Legazpi, and still held in the greatest of reverence at Ceb&#250;. The opposition of certain chiefs to the king of Ceb&#250; is satisfactorily ended by the inducements and threats of Magalh&#227;es. The latter swears to be faithful in his friendship with the natives, who likewise swear allegiance to the king of Spain. However, the natives are loath to destroy their idols, according to their promise, and Magalh&#227;es finds them still sacrificing to them for the cure of sickness. Substituting therefore the assurance that the new faith will work a cure, in lieu of which he offers his head, the sick man (who is the prince&#8217;s brother and the bravest and wisest man in the island) is miraculously cured. Thereupon many idols are burned amid great demonstrations. Vivid descriptions are given of the people and their customs and ceremonies, especially those of sacrifice and mourning.

 </p><p>April 20, a chief from the neighboring island of Mactan sends a small present to Magalh&#227;es, with the request to aid him with a boat load of men against the chief Cilapulapu, who refuses allegiance to Spain. Magalh&#227;es in his ardor, and notwithstanding the remonstrances of his friends, leads three boat loads of men (sixty in all) to the island, where having ordered the king of Ceb&#250; to be a witness of the battle only, he engages the natives. Disastrous indeed does that day prove, for beset by multitudes of <pb id="pb21" n="21"/>foes, the Europeans are compelled to retreat, and the retreat becomes a rout, the personal bravery of Magalh&#227;es and a few of his closest friends only saving the men from almost complete massacre. Recognizing the leader, the natives make their greatest efforts against him, and finally he is killed while knee deep in the water, but after all the others are saved. Pigafetta&#8217;s lament is tragic and sorrowful; they &#8220;killed our mirror, our light, our comfort, and our true guide.&#8221; Insolent in their victory, the natives refuse to give up the body of the slain leader at the request of the king of Ceb&#250;. The Europeans stunned by the loss of their leader, withdraw their merchandise and guards to the ship, and make preparations for departure. Duarte Barbosa and Jo&#227;o de Serr&#227;o are chosen leaders. The second act in the drama follows speedily. The slave Enrique, enraged at a severe reprimand and threats by Barbosa, conspires with the king of Ceb&#250;; with the result that twenty-six men, including both of the leaders, are murdered at a banquet on May 1, to which the king invites them. Jo&#227;o Carvalho, deaf to the entreaties of Jo&#227;o Serr&#227;o, his comrade, and anxious to become leader, sails away leaving him to his death. Pigafetta names the products of Ceb&#250;, and gives a valuable vocabulary of Visayan words, most of which are still in use by those people.

 </p><p>By mutual consent, the three vessels proceed to Bohol, where the &#8220;Concepcion&#8221; is burned, as there are too few men left to work all three ships; although its supplies and all else possible are transferred to the &#8220;Victoria&#8221; and &#8220;Trinidad.&#8221; Then, cruising along, they put in at Mindanao where Pigafetta goes ashore alone, after the king has made <pb id="pb22" n="22"/>blood friendship at the ships. There they hear of Luz&#243;n, where the Chinese trade annually. Departing from Mindanao, they anchor at Cagayan Sulu, a penal settlement for Borneo, where the blowpipe and poisoned arrows are used, and the daggers adorned with gold. The next anchorage is at Paragua, although before reaching that island, the men have been tempted to abandon the ships because of hunger. There the rice is cooked under the fire in bamboos and is better than that cooked in earthen pots. Those people raise fighting cocks and bet on their favorite birds. Ten leagues from Paragua is the great island of Borneo, whither the ships next go, and anchor at the city of Brunei, which is built over the water, and contains twenty-five thousand fires. Hospitably received by eight chiefs who visit the ships, they enter into relations with the Borneans. Seven men go as ambassadors to visit the king, and bear presents to him and the chief men. Here some of the grandeurs of an oriental court are spread before their eyes, which Pigafetta briefly describes. The strangers are graciously given permission to take on fresh supplies of food, water, and wood, and to trade at pleasure. Later actions of the Borneans cause the men of the ships to fear treachery, and forestalling any action by that people, they attack a number of junks near them, and capture four. Among the captives is the son of the king of Luz&#243;n, who is the chief captain in Borneo, and whom Carvalho allows to escape, without consulting the others, for a large sum of gold. His action in so doing reacts on himself, for the king refuses to allow two men who were ashore and Carvalho&#8217;s own son (born of a native woman in Brazil) to return to the ships, and <pb id="pb23" n="23"/>they are left behind. The Borneans and their junks are described. They use porcelain dishes which are made from a fine white clay that is buried under ground for fifty years in order to refine it, and inherited from father to son. Camphor is obtained there, and the island is so large that it can be circumnavigated by a prau only in three months&#8217; time.

 </p><p>On leaving Borneo, a number of prisoners from the captured junks are kept, among them three women whom Carvalho ostensibly retains as presents for the queen of Spain, but in reality for himself. Happily escaping from the point on which one of the ships has become grounded, and the fear of explosion from a candle which is snuffed into a barrel of powder, the ships anchor at a point of Borneo, where for forty-two days, the men are busied in repairing, calking, and furnishing the vessels. The journey is resumed back toward Paragua, the governor of a district of that island being captured on the way; with whom, however, they enter into friendly relations. Thence the ships cruise along between Cagayan, Jol&#243;, and Mindanao, capturing a native boat from Maingdanao of the latter island, from the captive occupants of which they learn news of the Moluccas. Pushing on amid stormy weather, they anchor at the island of Sarangani, just south of Mindanao; and thence proceed in a generally southerly direction amid many islands until the Moluccas are reached, and they enter the harbor of Tidore on Friday, November 8, 1521, after twenty-seven months, less two days, since their departure from Spain.

 </p><p>At Tidore a warm welcome awaits them from the king, who is a powerful astrologer and has been expecting <pb id="pb24" n="24"/>their arrival. He promises them as many cloves as they wish, even offering to go outside his island, contrary to the practice of kings, to provide them the sooner; in return for his services hoping for their aid in his designs for power in the Moluccas, especially against the king of Ternate. There they learn that Francisco Serr&#227;o, the great friend of Magalh&#227;es, has perished some eight months previously from poison administered by the king of Tidore, whom he had visited, because he had aided the king of Ternate against Tidore. This Serr&#227;o, says Pigafetta, was the cause of Magalh&#227;es undertaking his expedition, and he had been in the Moluccas for ten years, for so long ago had Portugal discovered those islands. The efforts of the Ternatans to gain the new strangers fail, for they are already pledged to the king of Tidore. On November 12, a house is built ashore and on the thirteenth the merchandise is carried there, among it being that captured with the various junks at and near Borneo. The sailors are somewhat careless of their bargains for they are in haste to return to Spain. The king continues his kindness, and to humor him, as he is a Mahometan, all the swine in the boats are killed. This relation will be concluded in <hi rend="sc">Vol. XXXIV</hi>.

 </p><p n="2">Inasmuch as, most illustrious and excellent Lord, there are many curious persons who not only take pleasure in knowing and hearing the great and wonderful things which God has permitted me to see and suffer during my long and dangerous voyage, hereto appended, but who also wish to know the means and manners and paths that I have taken in making that voyage [<hi>literally</hi>: &#8220;in going thither&#8221;]; and who do not lend that entire faith to the end unless they have a perfect assurance of the beginning: therefore, your most illustrious Lordship must know that, finding myself, in the year of the nativity of our Savior MCCCCCXIX in Spagnia, in the court of the most serene king of the Romans,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r5" target="n5">5</ref></hi> with the reverend Monsignor, Francesco Chieregato, then apostolic protonotary and nuncio of Pope Leo X of holy memory (and who has since become bishop of Aprutino and prince of Teramo),<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r6" target="n6">6</ref></hi> and having learned many things from many books that I had read, as well as from various persons,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r7" target="n7">7</ref></hi> who discussed the great and marvelous things of the Ocean Sea with his Lordship, <pb id="pb29" n="29"/>I determined, by the good favor of his C&#230;sarean Majesty, and of his Lordship abovesaid, to experience and to go to see those things for myself, so that I might be able thereby to satisfy myself somewhat, and so that I might be able to gain some renown for later posterity.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r8" target="n8">8</ref></hi> Having heard that a fleet composed of five vessels had been fitted out in the city of Siviglia for the purpose of going to discover the spicery in the islands of Maluco, under command of Captain-general Fernando de Magaglianes,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r9" target="n9">9</ref></hi> a Portuguese gentleman, comendador of the [Order of] Santo Jacobo de la Spada [<hi>i.e.</hi>, &#8220;St. James of the Sword&#8221;],<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r10" target="n10">10</ref></hi> [who] had many times traversed the Ocean Sea in various directions, whence he had acquired great praise, I set out from the city of Barsalonna, where his Majesty was then residing, bearing many letters in my favor. I went by ship as far as Malega, where, taking the highroad, I went overland to Siviglia. Having been there about three full months, waiting for the said fleet to be set in order for the departure,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r11" target="n11">11</ref></hi> finally, as your most excellent Lordship will learn below, we commenced our voyage under most happy auspices. And inasmuch as when I was in Ytalia and going to see his Holiness, Pope Clement,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r12" target="n12">12</ref></hi> you by your grace showed yourself very kind and good to me at Monteroso, and told me that you would be greatly pleased if I would write down for you all those things which I had seen and suffered during my voyage; and although I have had little opportunity, yet I have tried to satisfy your desire according to my poor ability; therefore, I offer you, in this little book of mine, all my vigils, hardships, and wanderings, begging you, although <pb id="pb31" n="31"/>you are busied with continual Rhodian cares, to deign to skim through it, by which I shall be enabled to receive a not slight remuneration from your most illustrious Lordship, to whose good favor I consign and commend myself.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r13" target="n13">13</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="3">The captain-general having resolved to make so long a voyage through the Ocean Sea, where furious winds and great storms are always reigning, but not desiring to make known to any of his men the voyage that he was about to make, so that they might not be cast down at the thought of doing so great and extraordinary a deed, as he did accomplish with the aid of God (the captains who accompanied him, hated him exceedingly, I know not why, unless because he was a Portuguese, and they Spaniards), with the desire to conclude what he promised under oath to the emperor, Don Carlo, king of Spagnia, prescribed the following orders and gave them to all the pilots and masters of his ships, so that the ships might not become separated from one another during the storms and night.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r14" target="n14">14</ref></hi> These were [to the effect] that he would always precede the other ships at night, and they were to follow his ship which would have a large torch of wood, which they call <hi>farol</hi>.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r15" target="n15">15</ref></hi> He always carried that <hi>farol</hi> set at the poop of his ship as a signal so that they might always follow him. Another light was made by means of a lantern or by means of a piece of wicking made from a rush and called <hi>sparto</hi> rope<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r16" target="n16">16</ref></hi> which is well beaten in the water, and then dried in the sun or in the smoke&#8212;a most excellent material for such use. They were to answer him so that he might know by that signal whether all of the ships were coming together. <pb id="pb33" n="33"/>If he showed two lights besides that of the <hi>farol</hi>, they were to veer or take another tack, [doing this] when the wind was not favorable or suitable for us to continue on our way, or when he wished to sail slowly. If he showed three lights, they were to lower away the bonnet-sail, which is a part of the sail that is fastened below the mainsail, when the weather is suitable for making better time. It is lowered so that it may be easier to furl the mainsail when it is struck hastily during a sudden squall.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r17" target="n17">17</ref></hi> If he showed four lights, they were to strike all the sails;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r18" target="n18">18</ref></hi> after which he showed a signal by one light, [which meant] that he was standing still. If he showed a greater number of lights, or fired a mortar, it was a signal of land or of shoals.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r19" target="n19">19</ref></hi> Then he showed four lights when he wished to have the sails set full, so that they might always sail in his wake by the torch on the poop. When he desired to set the bonnet-sail, he showed three lights.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r20" target="n20">20</ref></hi> When he desired to alter his course, he showed two;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r21" target="n21">21</ref></hi> and then if he wished to ascertain whether all the ships were following and whether they were coming together, he showed one light, so that each one of the ships might do the same and reply to him. Three watches were set nightly: the first at the beginning of the night; the second, which is called the midnight,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r22" target="n22">22</ref></hi> and the third at the end [of the night]. All of the men in the ships were divided into three parts: the first was the division of the captain or boatswain, those two alternating nightly; the second, of either the pilot or boatswain&#8217;s mate; and the third, of the master.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r23" target="n23">23</ref></hi> Thus did the captain-general order that all the ships observe the above signals and watches, so that their voyage might be more propitious.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r24" target="n24">24</ref></hi>

 <pb id="pb35" n="35"/></p><p n="4">On Monday morning, August x, St. Lawrence&#8217;s day, in the year abovesaid, the fleet, having been supplied with all the things necessary for the sea,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r25" target="n25">25</ref></hi> (and counting those of every nationality, we were two hundred and thirty-seven men), made ready to leave the harbor of Siviglia.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r26" target="n26">26</ref></hi> Discharging many pieces of artillery, the ships held their forestaysails to the wind, and descended the river Betis, at present called Gadalcavir, passing by a village called Gioan dal Farax, once a large Moorish settlement. In the midst of it was once a bridge that crossed the said river, and led to Siviglia. Two columns of that bridge have remained even to this day at the bottom of the water, and when ships sail by there, they need men who know the location of the columns thoroughly, so that the ships may not strike against them. They must also be passed when the river is highest with the tide; as must also many other villages along the river, which has not sufficient depth [of itself] for ships that are laden and which are not very large to pass. Then the ships reached another village called Coria, and passed by many other villages along the river, until they came to a castle of the duke of Medina Cidonia, called San Lucar, which is a port by which to enter the Ocean Sea.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r27" target="n27">27</ref></hi> It is in an east and west direction with the cape of Sanct Vincent, which lies in 37 degrees of latitude, and x leguas from the said port.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r28" target="n28">28</ref></hi> From Siviglia to this point [<hi>i.e.</hi>, San Lucar], it is 17 or 20 leguas by river.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r29" target="n29">29</ref></hi> Some days after, the captain-general, with his other captains, descended the river in the small boats belonging to their ships. We remained there for a considerable number of days in order to finish<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r30" target="n30">30</ref></hi> <pb id="pb37" n="37"/>[providing] the fleet with some things that it needed. Every day we went ashore to hear mass in a village called Nostra Dona de Baremeda [our Lady of Barrameda], near San Lucar. Before the departure, the captain-general wished all the men to confess, and would not allow any<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r31" target="n31">31</ref></hi> woman to sail in the fleet for the best of considerations.

 </p><p n="5">We left that village, by name San Luchar, on Tuesday, September xx of the same year, and took a southwest course.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r32" target="n32">32</ref></hi> On the 26th<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r33" target="n33">33</ref></hi> of the said month, we reached an island of the Great Canaria, called Teneriphe, which lies in a latitude of 28 degrees, [landing there] in order to get flesh, water, and wood.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r34" target="n34">34</ref></hi> We stayed there for three and one-half days in order to furnish the fleet with the said supplies. Then we went to a port of the same island called Monte Rosso<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r35" target="n35">35</ref></hi> to get pitch,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r36" target="n36">36</ref></hi> staying [there] two days. Your most illustrious Lordship must know that there is a particular one of the islands of the Great Canaria, where one can not find a single drop of water which gushes up [from a spring];<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r37" target="n37">37</ref></hi> but that at noontide a cloud descends from the sky and encircles a large tree which grows in the said island, the leaves and branches of which distil a quantity of water. At the foot of the said tree runs a trench which resembles a spring, where all the water falls, and from which the people living there, and the animals, both domestic and wild, fully satisfy themselves daily with this water and no other.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r38" target="n38">38</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="6">At midnight of Monday, October three, the sails were trimmed toward the south,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r39" target="n39">39</ref></hi> and we took to the open Ocean Sea, passing between Cape Verde and its islands in 14 and one-half degrees. Thus for <pb id="pb39" n="39"/>many days did we sail along the coast of Ghinea, or Ethiopia, where there is a mountain called Siera Leona, which lies in 8 degrees of latitude, with contrary winds, calms, and rains without wind, until we reached the equinoctial line, having sixty days of continual rain.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r40" target="n40">40</ref></hi> Contrary to the opinion of the ancients,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r41" target="n41">41</ref></hi> before we reached the line many furious squalls of wind, and currents of water struck us head on in 14 degrees. As we could not advance, and in order that the ships might not be wrecked,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r42" target="n42">42</ref></hi> all the sails were struck; and in this manner did we wander hither and yon on the sea, waiting for the tempest to cease, for it was very furious.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r43" target="n43">43</ref></hi> When it rained there was no wind. When the sun shone, it was calm. Certain large fishes called <hi>tiburoni</hi> [<hi>i.e.</hi>, sharks] came to the side of the ships. They have terrible teeth, and whenever they find men in the sea they devour them. We caught many of them with iron hooks,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r44" target="n44">44</ref></hi> although they are not good to eat unless they are small, and even then they are not very good. During those storms the holy body, that is to say St. Elmo, appeared to us many times, in light&#8212;among other times on an exceedingly dark night,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r45" target="n45">45</ref></hi> with the brightness of a blazing torch, on the maintop, where he stayed for about two hours or more, to our consolation, for we were weeping. When that blessed light was about to leave us, so dazzling was the brightness that it cast into our eyes, that we all remained for more than an eighth of an hour<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r46" target="n46">46</ref></hi> blinded and calling for mercy. And truly when we thought that we were dead men, the sea suddenly grew calm.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r47" target="n47">47</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="7">I saw many kinds of birds, among them one that had no anus; and another, [which] when the female <pb id="pb41" n="41"/>wishes to lay its eggs, it does so on the back of the male and there they are hatched. The latter bird has no feet, and always lives in the sea. [There is] another kind which live on the ordure of the other birds, and in no other manner; for I often saw this bird, which is called Cagassela, fly behind the other birds, until they are constrained to drop their ordure, which the former seizes immediately and abandons the latter bird. I also saw many flying fish, and many others collected together, so that they resembled an island.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r48" target="n48">48</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="8">After we had passed the equinoctial line going south, we lost the north star, and hence we sailed south south-west<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r49" target="n49">49</ref></hi> until [we reached] a land called the land of Verzin<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r50" target="n50">50</ref></hi> which lies in 23&#189; degrees of the Antarctic Pole [<hi>i.e.</hi>, south latitude]. It is the land extending from the cape of Santo Augustino, which lies in 8 degrees of the same pole. There we got a plentiful refreshment of fowls, potatoes [<hi>batate</hi>], many sweet pine-apples&#8212;in truth the most delicious fruit that can be found&#8212;the flesh of the <hi>anta</hi>,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r51" target="n51">51</ref></hi> which resembles beef, sugarcane, and innumerable other things, which I shall not mention in order not to be prolix. For one fishhook or one knife, those people gave 5 or 6 chickens; for one comb, a brace of geese; for one mirror or one pair of scissors, as many fish as would be sufficient for x men; for a bell or one leather lace, one basketful of potatoes [<hi>batate</hi>]. These potatoes resemble chestnuts in taste, and are as long as turnips.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r52" target="n52">52</ref></hi> For a king of diamonds [<hi>danari</hi>],<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r53" target="n53">53</ref></hi> which is a playing card, they gave me 6<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r54" target="n54">54</ref></hi> fowls and thought that they had even cheated me. We entered that port on St. Lucy&#8217;s day, <pb id="pb43" n="43"/>and on that day had the sun on the zenith;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r55" target="n55">55</ref></hi> and we were subjected to greater heat on that day and on the other days when we had the sun on the zenith, than when we were under the equinoctial line.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r56" target="n56">56</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="9">That land of Verzin is wealthier and larger than Spagnia, Fransa, and Italia,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r57" target="n57">57</ref></hi> put together, and belongs to the king of Portugalo. The people of that land are not Christians, and have no manner of worship. They live according to the dictates of nature,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r58" target="n58">58</ref></hi> and reach an age of one hundred and twenty-five and one hundred and forty years.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r59" target="n59">59</ref></hi> They go naked, both men and women. They live in certain long houses which they call <hi>boii</hi><hi rend="sup"><ref id="r60" target="n60">60</ref></hi> and sleep in cotton hammocks called <hi>amache</hi>, which are fastened in those houses by each end to large beams. A fire is built on the ground under those hammocks. In each one of those <hi>boii</hi>, there are one hundred men with their wives and children,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r61" target="n61">61</ref></hi> and they make a great racket. They have boats called canoes made of one single huge tree,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r62" target="n62">62</ref></hi> hollowed out by the use of stone hatchets. Those people employ stones as we do iron, as they have no iron. Thirty or forty men occupy one of those boats. They paddle with blades like the shovels of a furnace, and thus, black, naked, and shaven, they resemble, when paddling, the inhabitants of the Stygian marsh.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r63" target="n63">63</ref></hi> Men and women are as well proportioned as we. They eat the human flesh of their enemies, not because it is good, but because it is a certain established custom. That custom, which is mutual, was begun by an old woman,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r64" target="n64">64</ref></hi> who had but one son who was killed by his enemies. In return some days later, that old woman&#8217;s friends captured one of the company who had killed her <pb id="pb45" n="45"/>son, and brought him to the place of her abode. She seeing him, and remembering her son, ran upon him like an infuriated bitch, and bit him on one shoulder. Shortly afterward he escaped to his own people, whom he told that they had tried to eat him, showing them [in proof] the marks on his shoulder. Whomever the latter captured afterward at any time from the former they ate, and the former did the same to the latter, so that such a custom has sprung up in this way. They do not eat the bodies all at once, but every one cuts off a piece, and carries it to his house, where he smokes it. Then every week,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r65" target="n65">65</ref></hi> he cuts off a small bit, which he eats thus smoked with his other food to remind him of his enemies. The above was told me by the pilot, Johane Carnagio,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r66" target="n66">66</ref></hi> who came with us, and who had lived in that land for four years. Those people paint the whole body and the face in a wonderful manner with fire in various fashions, as do the women also. The men are [are: <hi>doublet in original manuscript</hi>] smooth shaven and have no beard, for they pull it out. They clothe themselves in a dress made of parrot feathers, with large round arrangements at their buttocks made from the largest feathers, and it is a ridiculous sight. Almost all the people, except the women and children,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r67" target="n67">67</ref></hi> have three holes pierced in the lower lip, where they carry round stones, one finger or thereabouts in length and hanging down outside. Those people are not entirely black, but of a dark brown color. They keep the privies uncovered, and the body is without hair,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r68" target="n68">68</ref></hi> while both men and women always go naked. Their king is called cacich [<hi>i.e.</hi>, cacique]. They have an infinite number of parrots, <pb id="pb47" n="47"/>and gave us 8 or 10 for one mirror: and little monkeys that look like lions, only [they are] yellow, and very beautiful.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r69" target="n69">69</ref></hi> They make round white [loaves of] bread from the marrowy substance of trees, which is not very good, and is found between the wood and the bark and resembles buttermilk curds.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r70" target="n70">70</ref></hi> They have swine which have their navels [<hi>lombelico</hi>] on their backs,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r71" target="n71">71</ref></hi> and large birds with beaks like spoons and no tongues.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r72" target="n72">72</ref></hi> The men gave us one or two of their young daughters as slaves for one hatchet or one large knife, but they would not give us their wives in exchange for anything at all. The women will not shame their husbands under any considerations whatever, and as was told us, refuse to consent to their husbands by day, but only by night.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r73" target="n73">73</ref></hi> The women cultivate the fields, and carry all their food from the mountains in panniers or baskets on the head or fastened to the head.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r74" target="n74">74</ref></hi> But they are always accompanied by their husbands, who are armed only with a bow of brazil-wood or of black palm-wood, and a bundle of cane arrows, doing this because they are jealous [of their wives]. The women carry their children hanging in a cotton net from their necks. I omit other particulars, in order not to be tedious. Mass was said twice on shore, during which those people remained on their knees with so great contrition and with clasped hands raised aloft, that it was an exceeding great pleasure<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r75" target="n75">75</ref></hi> to behold them. They built us a house as they thought that we were going to stay with them for some time, and at our departure they cut a great quantity of brazil-wood [<hi>verzin</hi>] to give us.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r76" target="n76">76</ref></hi> It had been about two months since it had rained in <pb id="pb49" n="49"/>that land, and when we reached that port, it happened to rain, whereupon they said that we came from the sky and that we had brought the rain with us.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r77" target="n77">77</ref></hi> Those people could be converted easily to the faith of Jesus Christ.

 </p><p n="10">At first those people thought that the small boats were the children of the ships, and that the latter gave birth to them when they were lowered into the sea from the ships, and when they were lying so alongside the ships (as is the custom), they believed that the ships were nursing them.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r78" target="n78">78</ref></hi> One day a beautiful young woman came to the flagship, where I was, for no other purpose than to seek what chance might offer. While there and waiting, she cast her eyes upon the master&#8217;s room, and saw a nail longer than one&#8217;s finger. Picking it up very delightedly and neatly, she thrust it through the lips of her vagina [<hi>natura</hi>], and bending down low immediately departed, the captain-general and I having seen that action.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r79" target="n79">79</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="12">We remained in that land for 13 days. Then proceeding, on our way, we went as far as 34 and one-third degrees<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r81" target="n81">81</ref></hi> toward the Antarctic Pole, <pb id="pb51" n="51"/>where we found people at a freshwater river, called Canibali [<hi>i.e.</hi>, cannibals], who eat human flesh. One of them, in stature almost a giant, came to the flagship in order to assure [the safety of] the others his friends.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r82" target="n82">82</ref></hi> He had a voice like a bull. While he was in the ship, the others carried away their possessions from the place where they were living into the interior, for fear of us. Seeing that, we landed one hundred men in order to have speech and converse with them, or to capture one of them by force. They fled, and in fleeing they took so large a step that we although running could not gain on their steps. There are seven islands in that river, in the largest of which precious gems are found. That place is called the cape of Santa Maria, and it was formerly thought that one passed thence to the sea of Sur, that is to say the South Sea, but nothing further was ever discovered. Now the name is not [given to] a cape, but [to] a river, with a mouth 17 leguas in width.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r83" target="n83">83</ref></hi> A Spanish captain, called Johan de Solis and sixty men, who were going to discover lands like us, were formerly eaten at that river by those cannibals because of too great confidence.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r84" target="n84">84</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="13">Then proceeding on the same course toward the Antarctic Pole, coasting along the land, we came to anchor at two islands full of geese and sea-wolves.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r85" target="n85">85</ref></hi> Truly, the great number of those geese cannot be reckoned; in one hour we loaded the five ships [with them]. Those geese are black and have all their feathers alike both on body and wings. They do not fly, and live on fish. They were so fat that it was not necessary to pluck them but to skin them. Their beak is like that of a crow. Those sea-wolves are of various colors, and as large as a calf, <pb id="pb53" n="53"/>with a head like that of a calf, ears small and round, and large teeth. They have no legs but only feet with small nails attached to the body, which resemble our hands, and between their fingers the same kind of skin as the geese. They would be very fierce if they could run. They swim, and live on fish. At that place the ships suffered a very great storm, during which the three holy bodies appeared to us many times, that is to say, St. Elmo, St. Nicholas, and St. Clara, whereupon the storm quickly ceased.

 </p><p n="14">Leaving that place, we finally reached 49 and one-half degrees toward the Antarctic Pole. As it was winter, the ships entered a safe port to winter.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r86" target="n86">86</ref></hi> We passed two months in that place without seeing anyone. One day we suddenly saw a naked man of giant stature on the shore of the port, dancing,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r87" target="n87">87</ref></hi> singing, and throwing dust on his head. The captain-general sent one of our men to the giant so that he might perform the same, actions as a sign of peace. Having done that, the man led the giant to an islet into the presence of the captain-general. When the giant was in the captain-general&#8217;s and our presence, he marveled greatly,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r88" target="n88">88</ref></hi> and made signs with one finger raised upward, believing that we had come from the sky. He was so tall that we reached only to his waist, and he was well proportioned. His face was large and painted red all over while about his eyes he was painted yellow; and he had two hearts painted on the middle of his cheeks. His scanty hair was painted white.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r89" target="n89">89</ref></hi> He was dressed in the skins of animals skilfully sewn together. That animal has a head and ears as large as those of a <pb id="pb55" n="55"/>mule, a neck and body like those of a camel, the legs of a deer, and the tail of a horse, like which it neighs, and that land has very many of them.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r90" target="n90">90</ref></hi> His feet were shod with the same kind of skins which covered his feet in the manner of shoes.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r91" target="n91">91</ref></hi> In his hand he carried a short, heavy bow, with a cord somewhat thicker than those of the lute,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r92" target="n92">92</ref></hi> and made from the intestines of the same animal, and a bundle of rather short cane arrows feathered like ours, and with points of white and black flint stones in the manner of Turkish arrows, instead of iron. Those points were fashioned by means of another stone.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r93" target="n93">93</ref></hi> The captain-general had the giant given something to eat and drink, and among other things which were shown to him was a large steel mirror. When he saw his face, he was greatly terrified, and jumped back throwing three or four<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r94" target="n94">94</ref></hi> of our men to the ground. After that he was given some bells, a mirror, a comb, and certain Pater Nosters. The captain-general sent him ashore with 4 armed men. When one of his companions, who would never come to the ships, saw him coming with our men, he ran to the place where the others were, who came [down to the shore] all naked one after the other. When our men reached them, they began to dance and to sing, lifting one finger to the sky. They showed our men some white powder made from the roots of an herb, which they kept in earthen pots, and which they ate because they had nothing else. Our men made signs inviting them to the ships, and that they would help them carry their possessions. Thereupon, those men quickly took only their bows, while their women laden like asses carried everything. The latter are <pb id="pb57" n="57"/>not so tall as the men but are very much fatter. When we saw them we were greatly surprised. Their breasts are one-half braza long, and they are painted and clothed like their husbands, except that before their privies [<hi>natura</hi>] they have a small skin which covers them. They led four of those young animals, fastened with thongs like a halter. When those people wish to catch some of those animals, they tie one of these young ones to a thornbush. Thereupon, the large ones come to play with the little ones; and those people kill them with their arrows from their place of concealment. Our men led eighteen of those people, counting men and women, to the ships, and they were distributed on the two sides of the port so that they might catch some of the said animals.

 </p><p n="15">Six days after the above, a giant painted<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r95" target="n95">95</ref></hi> and clothed in the same manner was seen by some [of our men] who were cutting wood. He had a bow and arrows in his hand. When our men approached him, he first touched his head, face,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r96" target="n96">96</ref></hi> and body, and then did the same to our men, afterward lifting his hands toward the sky. When the captain-general was informed of it, he ordered him to be brought in the small boat. He was taken to that island in the port where our men had built a house for the smiths<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r97" target="n97">97</ref></hi> and for the storage of some things from the ships. That man was even taller and better built than the others and as tractable and amiable. Jumping up and down, he danced, and when he danced, at every leap, his feet sank a palmo into the earth. He remained with us for a considerable number of days, so long that we baptized him, calling him Johanni. <pb id="pb59" n="59"/>He uttered [the words] &#8220;<hi>Jesu</hi>,&#8221; &#8220;<hi>Pater Noster</hi>,&#8221; &#8220;<hi>Ave Maria</hi>&#8221; and &#8220;<hi>Jovani</hi>&#8221; [<hi>i.e.</hi>, John<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r97b" target="n97b">97</ref></hi> as distinctly as we, but with an exceedingly loud voice. Then the captain-general gave him a shirt, a woolen jerkin [<hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">camisota de panno</hi>], cloth breeches, a cap, a mirror, a comb, bells, and other things, and sent him away like his companions. He left us very joyous and happy. The following day he brought one of those large animals to the captain-general, in return for which many things were given to him, so that he might bring some more to us; but we did not see him again. We thought that his companions had killed him because he had conversed with us.

 </p><p n="16">A fortnight later we saw four of those giants without their arms for they had hidden them in certain bushes as the two whom we captured showed us. Each one was painted differently. The captain-general kept two of them&#8212;the youngest and best proportioned&#8212;by means of a very cunning trick, in order to take them to Spagnia.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r98" target="n98">98</ref></hi> Had he used any other means [than those he employed], they could easily have killed some of us.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r99" target="n99">99</ref></hi> The trick that he employed in keeping them was as follows. He gave them many knives, scissors, mirrors, bells, and glass beads; and those two having their hands filled with the said articles, the captain-general had two pairs of iron manacles brought, such as are fastened on the feet.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r100" target="n100">100</ref></hi> He made motions that he would give them to the giants, whereat they were very pleased since those manacles were of iron, but they did not know how to carry them. They were grieved at leaving them behind, but they had no place to put those gifts; for they had to hold the skin wrapped <pb id="pb61" n="61"/>about them with their hands.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r101" target="n101">101</ref></hi> The other two giants wished to help them, but the captain refused. Seeing that they were loth to leave those manacles behind, the captain made them a sign that he would put them on their feet, and that they could carry them away. They nodded assent with the head. Immediately, the captain had the manacles put on both of them at the same time. When our men were driving home the cross bolt, the giants began to suspect something, but the captain assuring them, however, they stood still. When they saw later that they were tricked, they raged like bulls, calling loudly for <hi>Setebos</hi><hi rend="sup"><ref id="r102" target="n102">102</ref></hi> to aid them. With difficulty could we bind the hands of the other two, whom we sent ashore with nine of our men, in order that the giants might guide them to the place where the wife of one of the two whom we had captured<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r103" target="n103">103</ref></hi> was; for the latter expressed his great grief at leaving her by signs so that we understood [that he meant] her. While they were on their way, one of the giants freed his hands, and took to his heels with such swiftness that our men lost sight of him. He went to the place where his associates were, but he did not find [there] one of his companions, who had remained behind with the women, and who had gone hunting. He immediately went in search of the latter, and told him all that had happened.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r104" target="n104">104</ref></hi> The other giant endeavored so hard to free himself from his bonds, that our men struck him, wounding him slightly on the head, whereat he raging led them to where the women were. Gioan Cavagio, the pilot and commander of those men, refused to bring back the woman<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r105" target="n105">105</ref></hi> that night, but determined to sleep there, <pb id="pb63" n="63"/>for night was approaching. The other two giants came, and seeing their companion wounded, hesitated,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r106" target="n106">106</ref></hi> but said nothing then. But with the dawn, they spoke<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r107" target="n107">107</ref></hi> to the women, [whereupon] they immediately ran away (and the smaller ones ran faster than the taller), leaving all their possessions behind them. Two of them turned aside to shoot their arrows at our men. The other was leading away those small animals of theirs in order to hunt.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r108" target="n108">108</ref></hi> Thus fighting, one of them pierced the thigh of one of our men with an arrow, and the latter died immediately. When the giants saw that, they ran away quickly. Our men had muskets and crossbows, but they could never hit any of the giants, [for] when the latter fought, they never stood still, but leaped hither and thither. Our men buried their dead companion, and burned all the possessions left behind by the giants. Of a truth those giants run swifter than horses and are exceedingly jealous of their wives.

 </p><p n="17">When those people feel sick at the stomach, instead of purging themselves,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r109" target="n109">109</ref></hi> they thrust an arrow down their throat for two palmos or more<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r110" target="n110">110</ref></hi> and vomit [substance of a] green color mixed with blood, for they eat a certain kind of thistle. When they have a headache, they cut themselves across the forehead; and they do the same on the arms or on the legs and in any part of the body, letting a quantity of blood. One of those whom we had captured, and whom we kept in our ship, said that the blood refused to stay there [<hi>i.e.</hi>, in the place of the pain], and consequently causes them suffering. They wear their hair cut with the tonsure, like friars, but it is <pb id="pb65" n="65"/>left longer;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r111" target="n111">111</ref></hi> and they have a cotton cord wrapped about the head, to which they fasten their arrows when they go hunting. They bind their privies close to their bodies because of the exceeding great cold.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r112" target="n112">112</ref></hi> When one of those people die, x or twelve demons all painted appear to them and dance very joyfully about the corpse. They notice that one of those demons is much taller than the others, and he cries out and rejoices more.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r113" target="n113">113</ref></hi> They paint themselves exactly in the same manner as the demon appears to them painted. They call the larger demon Setebos,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r114" target="n114">114</ref></hi> and the others Cheleulle. That giant also told us by signs that he had seen the demons with two horns on their heads, and long hair which hung to the feet belching forth fire from mouth and buttocks. The captain-general called those people Patagoni.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r115" target="n115">115</ref></hi> They all clothe themselves in the skins of that animal above mentioned; and they have no houses except those made from the skin of the same animal, and they wander hither and thither with those houses just as the Cingani<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r116" target="n116">116</ref></hi> do. They live on raw flesh and on a sweet root which they call chapae.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r117" target="n117">117</ref></hi> Each of the two whom we captured ate a basketful of biscuit, and drank one-half pailful of water at a gulp. They also ate rats without skinning them.

 </p><p n="18">In that port which we called the port of Santo Julianno, we remained about five months.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r118" target="n118">118</ref></hi> Many things happened there. In order that your most illustrious Lordship may know some of them, it happened that as soon as we had entered the port, the captains of the other four ships plotted treason in order that they might kill the captain-general. Those conspirators consisted of the overseer of the <pb id="pb67" n="67"/>fleet, one Johan de Cartagena, the treasurer, Alouise de Mendosa, the accountant, Anthonio Cocha, and Gaspar de Cazada. The overseer of the men having been quartered, the treasurer was killed by dagger blows, for the treason was discovered. Some days after that, Gaspar de Casada, was banished with a priest in that land of Patagonia. The captain-general did not wish to have him killed, because the emperor, Don Carlo, had appointed him captain.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r119" target="n119">119</ref></hi> A ship called &#8220;Sancto Jacobo&#8221; was wrecked in an expedition made to explore the coast. All the men were saved as by a miracle, not even getting wet. Two of them came to the ships after suffering great hardships, and reported the whole occurrence to us. Consequently, the captain-general sent some men with bags full of biscuits [sufficient to last] for two months. It was necessary for us to carry them the food, for daily pieces of the ship [that was wrecked] were found. The way thither was long, [being] 24 leguas,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r120" target="n120">120</ref></hi> or one hundred millas, and the path was very rough and full of thorns. The men were 4 days on the road, sleeping at night in the bushes. They found no drinking water, but only ice, which caused them the greatest hardship.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r121" target="n121">121</ref></hi> There were very many long shellfish which are called <hi>missiglioni</hi><hi rend="sup"><ref id="r122" target="n122">122</ref></hi> in that port [of Santo Julianno]. They have pearls, although small ones in the middle, but could not be eaten. Incense, ostriches,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r123" target="n123">123</ref></hi> foxes, sparrows, and rabbits much smaller than ours were also found. We erected a cross on the top of the highest summit there, as a sign in that land that it belonged to the king of Spagnia; and we called that summit Monte de Christo [<hi>i.e.</hi>, Mount of Christ].

 <pb id="pb69" n="69"/></p><p n="19">Leaving that place, we found, in 51 degrees less one-third<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r124" target="n124">124</ref></hi> degree, toward the Antarctic Pole, a river of fresh water. There the ships almost perished because of the furious winds; but God and the holy bodies<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r125" target="n125">125</ref></hi> aided them. We stayed about two months in that river in order to supply the ships with water, wood, and fish, [the latter being] one braccio in length and more, and covered with scales. They were very good although small.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r126" target="n126">126</ref></hi> Before leaving that river, the captain-general and all of us confessed and received communion as true Christians.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r127" target="n127">127</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="20">Then going to fifty-two degrees toward the same pole,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r128" target="n128">128</ref></hi> we found a strait on the day of the [feast of the]<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r129" target="n129">129</ref></hi> eleven thousand virgins [i.e. October 21], whose head is called Capo de le Undici Millia Vergine [<hi>i.e.</hi>, cape of the Eleven Thousand Virgins] because of that very great miracle. That strait is one hundred and ten leguas or 440 millas long, and it is one-half legua broad, more or less.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r130" target="n130">130</ref></hi> It leads to another sea called the Pacific Sea, and is surrounded by very lofty mountains laden with snow. There it was impossible to find bottom [for anchoring], but [it was necessary to fasten] the moorings<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r131" target="n131">131</ref></hi> on land 25 or 30 brazas away. Had it not been for the captain-general, we would not have found that strait, for we all thought and said that it was closed on all sides. But the captain-general who knew where to sail to find a well-hidden strait, which he saw depicted on a map in the treasury of the king of Portugal, which was made by that excellent man, Martin de Boemia, sent two ships, the &#8220;Santo Anthonio&#8221; and the &#8220;Conceptione&#8221; (for thus they were called), to discover what was inside the cape de la <pb id="pb71" n="71"/>Baia [<hi>i.e.</hi>, of the Bay].<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r132" target="n132">132</ref></hi> We, with the other two ships, [namely], the flagship, called &#8220;Trinitade,&#8221; and the other the &#8220;Victoria,&#8221; stayed inside the bay to await them.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r133" target="n133">133</ref></hi> A great storm struck us that night, which lasted until the middle of next day, which necessitated our lifting anchor, and letting ourselves drift hither and thither about the bay. The other two ships suffered a headwind and could not double a cape<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r134" target="n134">134</ref></hi> formed by the bay almost at its end, as they were trying to return to join us; so that they thought that they would have to run aground. But on approaching the end of the bay, and thinking that they were lost, they saw a small opening which did not [exceed: <hi>crossed out in original MS.</hi>] appear to be an opening, but a sharp turn [<hi>cantone</hi>].<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r135" target="n135">135</ref></hi> Like desperate men they hauled into it, and thus they discovered the strait by chance. Seeing that it was not a sharp turn, but a strait with land, they proceeded farther, and found a bay.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r136" target="n136">136</ref></hi> And then farther on they found another strait and another bay larger than the first two.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r137" target="n137">137</ref></hi> Very joyful they immediately turned back to inform the captain-general. We thought that they had been wrecked, first, by reason of the violent storm, and second, because two days had passed and they had not appeared, and also because of certain [signals with] smoke made by two of their men who had been sent ashore to advise us.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r138" target="n138">138</ref></hi> And so, while in suspense, we saw the two ships with sails full and banners flying to the wind, coming toward us. When they neared us in this manner, they suddenly discharged a number of mortars, and burst into cheers.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r139" target="n139">139</ref></hi> Then all together thanking God and the Virgin Mary, we went to seek [the strait] farther on.

 <pb id="pb73" n="73"/></p><p n="21">After entering that strait, we found two openings, one to the southeast, and the other to the southwest.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r140" target="n140">140</ref></hi> The captain-general sent the ship &#8220;Sancto Anthonio&#8221; together with the &#8220;Concitione&#8221; to ascertain whether that opening which was toward the southeast had an exit into the Pacific Sea. The ship &#8220;Sancto Anthonio&#8221; would not await the &#8220;Conceptione,&#8221; because it intended to flee and return to Spagnia&#8212;which it did. The pilot of that ship was one Stefan Gomes,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r141" target="n141">141</ref></hi> and he hated the captain-general exceedingly, because before that fleet was fitted out, the emperor had ordered that he be given some caravels with which to discover lands, but his Majesty did not give them to him because of the coming of the captain-general. On that account he conspired with certain Spaniards, and next night they captured the captain of their ship, a cousin<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r142" target="n142">142</ref></hi> of the captain-general, one Alvaro de Meschita, whom they wounded and put in irons, and in this condition took to Spagnia. The other giant whom we had captured was in that ship, but he died when the heat came on. The &#8220;Conceptione,&#8221; as it could not follow that ship, waited for it, sailing about hither and thither. The &#8220;Sancto Anthonio&#8221; turned back at night and fled along the same [port: <hi>crossed out in original MS.</hi>] strait.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r143" target="n143">143</ref></hi> We had gone to explore the other opening toward the southwest. Finding, however, the same [port: <hi>crossed out in original MS.</hi>] strait continuously, we came upon a river which we called the river of Sardine [<hi>i.e.</hi>, Sardines], because there were many sardines near it.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r144" target="n144">144</ref></hi> So we stayed there for four days in order to await the two ships. During that period we sent a well-equipped boat to explore the <pb id="pb75" n="75"/>cape of the other sea. The men returned within three days, and reported that they had seen the cape and the open sea. The captain-general wept for joy, and called that cape, Cape Dezeado [<hi>i.e.</hi>, Desire],<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r145" target="n145">145</ref></hi> for we had been desiring it for a long time. We turned back to look for the two ships,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r146" target="n146">146</ref></hi> but we found only the &#8220;Conceptione.&#8221; Upon asking them where the other one was, Johan Seranno,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r147" target="n147">147</ref></hi> who was captain and pilot of the former ship (and also of that ship that had been wrecked) replied that he did not know, and that he had never seen it after it had entered the opening. We sought it in all parts of the strait, as far as that opening whence it had fled, and the captain-general sent the ship &#8220;Victoria&#8221; back to the entrance of the strait to ascertain whether the ship was there. Orders were given them, if they did not find it, to plant a banner on the summit of some small hill with a letter in an earthen pot buried in the earth near the banner, so that if the banner were seen the letter might be found, and the ship might learn the course that we were sailing. For this was the arrangement made between us in case that we went astray one from the other.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r148" target="n148">148</ref></hi> Two banners were planted with their letters&#8212;one on a little eminence in the first bay, and the other in an islet in the third bay<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r149" target="n149">149</ref></hi> where there were many sea-wolves and large birds. The captain-general waited for the ship with his other ship near he river of Isleo,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r150" target="n150">150</ref></hi> and he had a cross set up in an islet near that river, which flowed between high mountains covered with snow and emptied into the sea near the river of Sardine. Had we not discovered that strait, the captain-general had determined to go as far as seventy-five <pb id="pb77" n="77"/>degrees toward the Antarctic Pole. There in that latitude, during the summer season, there is no night, or if there is any night it is but short, and so in the winter with the day. In order that your most illustrious Lordship may believe it, when we were in that strait, the nights were only three hours long, and it was then the month of October.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r151" target="n151">151</ref></hi> The land on the left-hand side of that strait turned toward the southeast<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r152" target="n152">152</ref></hi> and was low. We called that strait the strait of Patagonia. One finds the safest of ports every half legua in it,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r153" target="n153">153</ref></hi> water, the finest of wood (but not of cedar), fish, sardines, and missiglioni, while smallage,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r154" target="n154">154</ref></hi> a sweet herb (although there is also some that is bitter) grows around the springs. We ate of it for many days as we had nothing else. I believe that there is not a more beautiful or better strait in the world than that one.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r155" target="n155">155</ref></hi> In that Ocean Sea one sees a very amusing fish hunt. The fish [that hunt] are of three sorts, and are one braza and more in length, and are called dorado, albicore, and bonito.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r156" target="n156">156</ref></hi> Those fish follow the flying fish called colondrini,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r157" target="n157">157</ref></hi> which are one palmo and more<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r158" target="n158">158</ref></hi> in length and very good to eat. When the above three kinds [of fish] find any of those flying fish, the latter immediately leap from the water and fly as long as their wings are wet&#8212;more than a crossbow&#8217;s flight. While they are flying, the others run along back of them under the water following the shadow of the flying fish. The latter have no sooner fallen into the water than the others immediately seize and eat them. It is in fine a very amusing thing to watch.

 </p><p n="23">All the above words are pronounced in the throat, for such is their method of pronunciation.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r161" target="n161">161</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="24">That giant whom we had in our ship told me those words; for when he, upon asking me for <hi>capac</hi>,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r162" target="n162">162</ref></hi> <pb id="pb87" n="87"/>that is to say, bread, as they call that root which they use as bread, and <hi>oli</hi>, that is to say, water, saw me write those words quickly, and afterward when I, with pen in hand, asked him for other words, he understood me. Once I made the sign of the cross, and, showing it to him, kissed it. He immediately cried out &#8220;Setebos,&#8221; and made me a sign that if I made the sign of the cross again, Setebos would enter into my body and cause it to burst. When that giant was sick, he asked for the cross, and embracing it and kissing it many times, desired to become a Christian before his death. We called him Paulo. When those people wish to make a fire, they rub a sharpened piece of wood against another piece until the fire catches in the pith of a certain tree, which is placed between those two sticks.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r163" target="n163">163</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="25">Wednesday, November 28, 1520, we debouched from that strait, engulfing ourselves in the Pacific Sea.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r164" target="n164">164</ref></hi> We were three months and twenty days without getting any kind of fresh food. We ate biscuit, which was no longer biscuit, but powder of biscuits swarming with worms, for they had eaten the good. It stank strongly of the urine of rats.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r165" target="n165">165</ref></hi> We drank yellow water that had been putrid for many days. We also ate some ox hides that covered the top of the mainyard to prevent the yard from chafing the shrouds, and which had become exceedingly hard because of the sun, rain, and wind.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r166" target="n166">166</ref></hi> We left them in the sea for four or five days, and then placed them for a few moments on top of the embers, and so ate them; and often we ate sawdust from boards. Rats were sold for one-half ducado apiece, and even then we could not get them.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r167" target="n167">167</ref></hi> But above all the other <pb id="pb89" n="89"/>misfortunes the following was the worst. The gums of both the lower and upper teeth of some of our men swelled, so that they could not eat under any circumstances and therefore died.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r168" target="n168">168</ref></hi> Nineteen men died from that sickness, and the giant together with an Indian from the country of Verzin. Twenty-five or thirty men fell sick [during that time], in the arms, legs, or in another place, so that but few remained well. However, I, by the grace of God, suffered no sickness. We sailed about four thousand leguas during those three months and twenty days through an open stretch in that Pacific Sea.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r169" target="n169">169</ref></hi> In truth it is very pacific,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r170" target="n170">170</ref></hi> for during that time we did not suffer any storm. We saw no land except two desert islets, where we found nothing but birds and trees, for which we called them the Ysolle Infortunate [<hi>i.e.</hi>, the Unfortunate Isles]. They are two hundred leguas apart. We found no anchorage, [but] near them saw many sharks.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r171" target="n171">171</ref></hi> The first islet lies in fifteen degrees of south latitude, and the other in nine. Daily we made runs of fifty, sixty, or seventy leguas at the catena or at the stern.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r172" target="n172">172</ref></hi> Had not God and His blessed mother given us so good weather we would all have died of hunger in that exceeding vast sea. Of a verity I believe no such voyage will ever be made [again].

 </p><p n="26">When we left that strait, if we had sailed continuously westward we would have circumnavigated the world without finding other land than the cape of the xi thousand Virgins.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r173" target="n173">173</ref></hi> The latter is a cape of that strait at the Ocean Sea, straight east and west with Cape Deseado of the Pacific Sea. Both of those capes lie in a latitude of exactly fifty-two degrees toward the Antarctic Pole.

 <pb id="pb93" n="93"/></p><p n="27">The Antarctic Pole is not so starry as the Arctic. Many small stars clustered together are seen, which have the appearance of two clouds of mist. There is but little distance between them, and they are somewhat dim. In the midst of them are two large and not very luminous stars, which move only slightly. Those two stars are the Antarctic Pole. Our loadstone, although it moved hither and thither, always pointed toward its own Arctic Pole, although it did not have so much strength as on its own side. And on that account when we were in that open expanse, the captain-general, asking all the pilots whether they were always sailing forward in the course which we had laid down on the maps, all replied: &#8220;By your course exactly as laid down.&#8221; He answered them that they were pointing wrongly&#8212;which was a fact&#8212;and that it would be fitting to adjust the needle of navigation, for it was not receiving so much force from its side. When we were in the midst of that open expanse, we saw a cross with five extremely bright stars straight toward the west, those stars being exactly placed with regard to one another.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r174" target="n174">174</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="28">During those days<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r175" target="n175">175</ref></hi> we sailed west northwest, northwest by west, and northwest, until we reached the equinoctial line at the distance of one hundred and twenty-two degrees from the line of demarcation. The line of demarcation is thirty degrees from the meridian, and the meridian is three degrees eastward from Capo Verde.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r176" target="n176">176</ref></hi> We passed while on that course, a short distance from two exceedingly rich islands, one in twenty degrees of the latitude of the Antarctic Pole, by name Cipangu, and the other in <pb id="pb95" n="95"/>fifteen degrees, by name Sumbdit Pradit.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r177" target="n177">177</ref></hi> After we had passed the equinoctial line we sailed west northwest, and west by north, and then for two hundred leguas toward the west, changing our course to west by south until we reached thirteen degrees toward the Arctic Pole in order that we might approach nearer to the land of cape Gaticara. That cape (with the pardon of cosmographers, for they have not seen it), is not found where it is imagined to be, but to the north in twelve degrees or thereabouts.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r178" target="n178">178</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="29">About seventy<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r179" target="n179">179</ref></hi> leguas on the above course, and lying in twelve degrees of latitude and 146 in longitude, we discovered on Wednesday, March 6, a small island to the northwest, and two others toward the southwest, one of which was higher and larger than the other two. The captain-general wished to stop at the large island and get some fresh food, but he was unable to do so because the inhabitants of that island entered the ships and stole whatever they could lay their hands on, so that we could not protect ourselves. The men were about to strike the sails so that we could go ashore, but the natives very deftly stole from us the small boat<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r180" target="n180">180</ref></hi> that was fastened to the poop of the flagship. Thereupon, the captain-general in wrath went ashore with forty armed men, who burned some forty or fifty houses together with many boats, and killed seven men.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r181" target="n181">181</ref></hi> He recovered the small boat, and we departed immediately pursuing the same course. Before we landed, some of our sick men begged us if we should kill any man or woman to bring the entrails to them, as they would recover immediately.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r182" target="n182">182</ref></hi>

 <pb id="pb97" n="97"/></p><p n="30">When we wounded any of those people with our crossbow-shafts, which passed completely through their loins from one side to the other, they, looking at it, pulled on the shaft now on this and now on that side,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r183" target="n183">183</ref></hi> and then drew it out, with great astonishment, and so died. Others who were wounded in the breast did the same, which moved us to great compassion. Those people seeing us departing followed us with more than one hundred<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r184" target="n184">184</ref></hi> boats for more than one legua. They approached the ships showing us fish, feigning that they would give them to us; but then threw stones at us and fled. And although the ships were under full sail, they passed between them and the small boats [fastened astern], very adroitly in those small boats of theirs. We saw some women in their boats who were crying out and tearing their hair, for love, I believe, of those whom we had killed.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r185" target="n185">185</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="31">Each one of those people lives according to his own will, for they have no seignior.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r186" target="n186">186</ref></hi> They go naked, and some are bearded and have black hair that reaches to the waist. They wear small palmleaf hats, as do the Albanians. They are as tall as we, and well built. They have no worship. They are tawny, but are born white. Their teeth are red and black, for they think that is most beautiful. The women go naked except that they wear a narrow strip of bark as thin as paper, which grows between the tree and the bark of the palm, before their privies. They are goodlooking and delicately formed, and lighter complexioned than the men; and wear their hair which is exceedingly black, loose and hanging quite down to the ground. The women <pb id="pb99" n="99"/>do not work in the fields but stay in the house, weaving mats,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r187" target="n187">187</ref></hi> baskets [<hi>casse</hi>: literally boxes], and other things needed in their houses, from palm leaves. They eat cocoanuts, camotes [<hi>batate</hi>],<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r188" target="n188">188</ref></hi> birds, figs one palmo in length [<hi>i.e.</hi>, bananas], sugarcane, and flying fish, besides other things. They<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r189" target="n189">189</ref></hi> anoint the body and the hair with cocoanut and beneseed oil. Their houses are all built of wood covered with planks and thatched with leaves of the fig-tree [<hi>i.e.</hi>, banana-tree] two brazas long; and they have floors and windows. The rooms and the beds are all furnished with the most beautiful palmleaf mats.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r190" target="n190">190</ref></hi> They sleep on palm straw which is very soft and fine. They use no weapons, except a kind of a spear pointed with a fishbone at the end. Those people are poor, but ingenious and very thievish, on account of which we called those three islands the islands of Ladroni [<hi>i.e.</hi>, of thieves].<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r191" target="n191">191</ref></hi> Their amusement, men and women, is to plough the seas with those small boats of theirs.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r192" target="n192">192</ref></hi> Those boats resemble <hi>fucelere</hi>,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r193" target="n193">193</ref></hi> but are narrower, and some are black, [some] white, and others red. At the side opposite the sail, they have a large piece of wood pointed at the top, with poles laid across it and resting on the water, in order that the boats may sail more safely. The sail is made from palmleaves sewn together and is shaped like a lateen sail. For rudders they use a certain blade resembling a hearth shovel which have a piece of wood at the end. They can change stern and bow at will [literally: they make the stern, bow, and the bow, stern],<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r194" target="n194">194</ref></hi> and those boats resemble the dolphins which leap in the water from wave to wave. Those Ladroni [<hi>i.e.</hi>, robbers] <pb id="pb103" n="103"/>thought, according to the signs which they made, that there were no other people in the world but themselves.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r195" target="n195">195</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="32">At dawn on Saturday, March sixteen,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r196" target="n196">196</ref></hi> 1521, we came upon a high land at a distance of three hundred leguas from the islands of Latroni&#8212;an island named Zamal [<hi>i.e.</hi>, Samar]. The following day, the captain-general desired to land on another island which was uninhabited and lay to the right of the abovementioned island, in order to be more secure, and to get water and have some rest. He had two tents set up on the shore for the sick and had a sow killed for them. On Monday afternoon, March 18, we saw a boat coming toward us with nine men in it. Therefore, the captain-general ordered that no one should move or say a word without his permission. When those men reached the shore, their chief went immediately to the captain-general, giving signs of joy because of our arrival. Five of the most ornately adorned of them remained with us, while the rest went to get some others who were fishing, and so they all came. The captain-general seeing that they were reasonable men, ordered food to be set before them, and gave them red caps, mirrors, combs, bells, ivory, bocasine,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r197" target="n197">197</ref></hi> and other things. When they saw the captain&#8217;s courtesy, they presented fish, a jar of palm wine, which they call <hi>uraca</hi> [<hi>i.e.</hi>, arrack], figs more than one palmo long [<hi>i.e.</hi>, bananas],<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r198" target="n198">198</ref></hi> and others which were smaller and more delicate, and two cocoanuts. They had nothing else then, but made us signs with their hands that they would bring <hi>umay</hi> or rice,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r199" target="n199">199</ref></hi> and cocoanuts and many other articles of food within four days.

 <pb id="pb105" n="105"/></p><p n="33">Cocoanuts are the fruit of the palmtree.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r200" target="n200">200</ref></hi> Just as we have bread, wine, oil, and milk, so those people get everything from that tree. They get wine in the following manner. They bore a hole into the heart of the said palm at the top called palmito [<hi>i.e.</hi>, stalk], from which distils a liquor<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r201" target="n201">201</ref></hi> which resembles white must. That liquor is sweet but somewhat tart, and [is gathered] in canes [of bamboo] as thick as the leg and thicker. They fasten the bamboo to the tree at evening for the morning, and in the morning for the evening. That palm bears a fruit, namely, the cocoanut, which is as large as the head or thereabouts. Its outside husk is green and thicker than two fingers. Certain filaments are found in that husk, whence is made cord for binding together their boats. Under that husk there is a hard shell, much thicker than the shell of the walnut, which they burn and make therefrom a powder that is useful to them.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r202" target="n202">202</ref></hi> Under that shell there is a white marrowy substance one finger in thickness, which they eat fresh with meat and fish as we do bread; and it has a taste resembling the almond. It could be dried and made into bread. There is a clear, sweet water in the middle of that marrowy substance which is very refreshing. When that water stands for a while after having been collected, it congeals and becomes like an apple. When the natives wish to make oil, they take that cocoanut, and allow the marrowy substance and the water to putrefy. Then they boil it and it becomes oil like butter. When they wish to make vinegar, they allow only the water to putrefy, and then place it in the sun, and a vinegar results like [that made from] white wine. <pb id="pb107" n="107"/>Milk can also be made from it for we made some. We scraped that marrowy substance and then mixed the scrapings with its own water which we strained through a cloth, and so obtained milk like goat&#8217;s milk. Those palms resemble date-palms, but although not smooth they are less knotty than the latter. A family of x persons can be supported on two trees, by utilizing them week about for the wine; for if they did otherwise, the trees would dry up. They last a century.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r203" target="n203">203</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="34">Those people became very familiar with us. They told us many things, their names and those of some of the islands that could be seen from that place. Their own island was called Zuluan and it is not very large.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r204" target="n204">204</ref></hi> We took great pleasure with them, for they were very pleasant and conversable. In order to show them greater honor, the captain-general<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r205" target="n205">205</ref></hi> took them to his ship and showed them all his merchandise&#8212;cloves, cinnamon, pepper, ginger, nutmeg, mace, gold, and all the things in the ship. He had some mortars fired for them, whereat they exhibited great fear, and tried to jump out of the ship.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r206" target="n206">206</ref></hi> They made signs to us that the abovesaid articles grew in that place where we were going. When they were about to retire they took their leave very gracefully and neatly, saying that they would return according to their promise. The island where we were is called Humunu; but inasmuch as we found two springs there of the clearest water, we called it Acquada da li buoni Segnialli [<hi>i.e.</hi>, &#8220;the Watering-place of good Signs&#8221;], for there were the first signs of gold which we found in those districts.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r207" target="n207">207</ref></hi> <pb id="pb109" n="109"/>We found a great quantity of white coral there, and large trees with fruit a trifle smaller than the almond and resembling pine seeds. There are also many palms, some of them good and others bad. There are many islands in that district, and therefore we called them the archipelago of San Lazaro, as they were discovered on the Sabbath of St. Lazurus.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r208" target="n208">208</ref></hi> They lie in x degrees of latitude toward the Arctic Pole, and in a longitude of one hundred and sixty-one degrees from the line of demarcation.

 </p><p n="35">At noon on Friday, March 22, those men came as they had promised us in two boats with cocoanuts, sweet oranges, a jar of palm-wine, and a cock,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r209" target="n209">209</ref></hi> in order to show us that there were fowls in that district. They exhibited great signs of pleasure at seeing us.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r210" target="n210">210</ref></hi> We purchased all those articles from them. Their seignior was an old man who was painted [<hi>i.e.</hi>, tattooed]. He wore two gold earrings [<hi>schione</hi>] in his ears,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r211" target="n211">211</ref></hi> and the others many gold armlets on their arms and kerchiefs about their heads. We stayed there one week, and during that time our captain went ashore daily to visit the sick, and<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r212" target="n212">212</ref></hi> every morning gave them cocoanut water from his own hand, which comforted them greatly. There are people living near that island<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r213" target="n213">213</ref></hi> who have holes in their ears so large that they can pass their arms through them. Those people are caphri,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r214" target="n214">214</ref></hi> that is to say, heathen. They go naked, with a cloth woven from the bark of a tree about their privies, except some of the chiefs who wear cotton cloth embroidered with silk at the ends by means of a needle. They are dark, fat, and painted. They anoint themselves with cocoanut and with beneseed oil, as a protection <pb id="pb113" n="113"/>against sun and wind. They have very black hair that falls to the waist, and use daggers, knives, and spears<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r215" target="n215">215</ref></hi> ornamented with gold, large shields, fascines,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r216" target="n216">216</ref></hi> javelins, and fishing nets that resemble rizali;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r217" target="n217">217</ref></hi> and their boats are like ours.

 </p><p n="36">On the afternoon of holy Monday, the day of our Lady, March twenty-five, while we were on the point of weighing anchor, I went to the side of the ship to fish, and putting my feet upon a yard leading down into the storeroom, they slipped, for it was rainy, and consequently I fell into the sea, so that no one saw me. When I was all but under, my left hand happened to catch hold of the clew-garnet of the mainsail, which was dangling [<hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">ascosa</hi>] in the water. I held on tightly, and began to cry out so lustily that I was rescued by the small boat. I was aided, not, I believe, indeed, through my merits, but through the mercy of that font of charity [<hi>i.e.</hi>, of the Virgin]. That same day we shaped our course toward the west southwest between four small islands, namely, Cenalo, Hiunanghan,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r218" target="n218">218</ref></hi> Ibusson, and Abarien.

 </p><p n="37">On Thursday morning, March twenty-eight, as we had seen a fire on an island the night before, we anchored near it.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r219" target="n219">219</ref></hi> We saw a small boat which the natives call <hi>boloto</hi> with eight men in it, approaching the flagship. A slave belonging to the captain-general, who was a native of Zamatra [<hi>i.e.</hi>, Sumatra], which was formerly called Traprobana, spoke to them. They immediately understood him, came alongside the ship, unwilling to enter but taking a position at some little distance.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r220" target="n220">220</ref></hi> The captain seeing that they would not trust us, threw them out a red cap and other things tied to a bit of wood. They <pb id="pb115" n="115"/>received them very gladly, and went away quickly to advise their king. About two hours later we saw two balanghai coming. They are large boats and are so called [by those people]. They were full of men, and their king was in the larger of them, being seated under an awning of mats. When the king came near the flagship, the slave spoke to him. The king understood him, for in those districts the kings know more languages than the other people. He ordered some of his men to enter the ships, but he always remained in his balanghai, at some little distance from the ship until his own men returned; and as soon as they returned he departed. The captain-general showed great honor to the men who entered the ship, and gave them some presents, for which the king wished before his departure to give the captain a large bar<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r221" target="n221">221</ref></hi> of gold and a basketful of ginger. The latter, however, thanked the king heartily but would not accept it. In the afternoon we went in the ships [and anchored] near the dwellings of the king.

 </p><p n="38">Next day, holy Friday, the captain-general sent his slave, who acted as our interpreter, ashore in a small boat to ask the king if he had any food to have it carried to the ships;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r222" target="n222">222</ref></hi> and to say that they would be well satisfied with us, for he [and his men] had come to the island as friends and not as enemies. The king came with six or eight men<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r223" target="n223">223</ref></hi> in the same boat and entered the ship. He embraced the captain-general to whom he gave three porcelain jars covered with leaves and full of raw rice, two very large <hi>orade</hi>,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r224" target="n224">224</ref></hi> and other things. The captain-general gave the king a garment of red and yellow cloth made in the Turkish fashion, and a fine red cap; and to the others (the king&#8217;s men), to some knives and to others mirrors. Then the captain-general <pb id="pb117" n="117"/>had a collation spread for them, and had the king told through the slave that he desired to be <hi>casi casi</hi><hi rend="sup"><ref id="r225" target="n225">225</ref></hi> with him, that is to say, brother. The king replied that he also wished to enter the same relations with the captain-general. Then the captain showed him cloth of various colors, linen, coral [ornaments], and many other articles of merchandise, and all the artillery, some of which he had discharged for him, whereat the natives were greatly frightened. Then the captain-general had a man armed as a soldier,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r226" target="n226">226</ref></hi> and placed him in the midst of three men armed with swords and daggers, who struck him on all parts of the body. Thereby was the king rendered almost speechless. The captain-general told him through the slave that one of those armed men was worth one hundred of his own men. The king answered that that was a fact. The captain-general said that he had two hundred men in each ship who were armed in that manner.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r227" target="n227">227</ref></hi> He showed the king cuirasses, swords, and bucklers, and had a review made for him.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r228" target="n228">228</ref></hi> Then he led the king to the deck of the ship, that is located above at the stern; and had his sea-chart and compass brought.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r229" target="n229">229</ref></hi> He told the king through the interpreter how he had found the strait in order to voyage thither, and how many moons he had been without seeing land, whereat the king was astonished. Lastly, he told the king that he would like, if it were pleasing to him, to send two of his men with him so that he might show them some of his things. The king replied that he was agreeable, and I went in company with one of the other men.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r230" target="n230">230</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="39">When I reached shore, the king raised his hands <pb id="pb119" n="119"/>toward the sky and then turned toward us two. We did the same toward him<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r231" target="n231">231</ref></hi> as did all the others. The king took me by the hand; one of his chiefs took my companion<corr sic=":">;</corr> and thus they led us under a bamboo covering, where there was a balanghai,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r232" target="n232">232</ref></hi> as long as eighty of my palm lengths, and resembling a fusta. We sat down upon the stern of that balanghai, constantly conversing with signs. The king&#8217;s men stood about us in a circle with swords, daggers, spears, and bucklers.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r233" target="n233">233</ref></hi> The king had a plate of pork brought in and a large jar filled with wine. At every mouthful, we drank a cup of wine. The wine that was left [in the cup] at any time, although that happened but rarely, was put into a jar by itself. The king&#8217;s cup was always kept covered and no one else drank from it but he and I. Before the king took the cup to drink, he raised his clasped hands toward the sky, and then toward me; and when he was about to drink, he extended the fist of his left hand toward me (at first I thought that he was about to strike me) and then drank. I did the same toward the king. They all make those signs one toward another when they drink. We ate with such ceremonies and with other signs of friendship. I ate meat on holy Friday, for I could not help myself. Before the supper hour I gave the king many things which I had brought. I wrote down the names of many things in their language. When the king and the others saw me writing, and when I told them their words, they were all astonished.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r234" target="n234">234</ref></hi> While engaged in that the supper hour was announced. Two large porcelain dishes were brought in, one full of rice and the other of pork with its gravy. <pb id="pb121" n="121"/>We ate with the same signs and ceremonies, after which we went to the palace of the king which was built like a hayloft and was thatched with fig [<hi>i.e.</hi>, banana] and palm leaves. It was built up high from the ground on huge posts of wood and it was necessary to ascend to it by means of ladders.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r235" target="n235">235</ref></hi> The king made us sit down there on a bamboo mat with our feet drawn up like tailors. After a half-hour a platter of roast fish cut in pieces was brought in, and ginger freshly gathered, and wine. The king&#8217;s eldest son, who was the prince, came over to us, whereupon the king told him to sit down near us, and he accordingly did so. Then two platters were brought in (one with fish and its sauce, and the other with rice), so that we might eat with the prince. My companion became intoxicated as a consequence of so much drinking and eating. They used the gum of a tree called <hi>anime</hi> wrapped in palm or fig [<hi>i.e.</hi>, banana] leaves for lights. The king made us a sign that he was going to go to sleep. He left the prince with us, and we slept with the latter on a bamboo mat with pillows made of leaves. When day dawned the king came and took me by the hand, and in that manner we went to where we had had supper, in order to partake of refreshments, but the boat came to get us. Before we left, the king kissed our hands with great joy, and we his. One of his brothers, the king of another island, and three men came with us. The captain-general kept him to dine with us, and gave him many things.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r236" target="n236">236</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="40">Pieces of gold, of the size of walnuts and eggs are found by sifting the earth in the island of that king who came to our ships. All the dishes of that <pb id="pb123" n="123"/>king are of gold and also some portion of his house, as we were told by that king himself. According to their customs he was very grandly decked out [<hi>molto in ordine</hi>],<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r237" target="n237">237</ref></hi> and the finest looking man that we saw among those people. His hair was exceedingly black, and hung to his shoulders. He had a covering of silk oh his head, and wore two large golden earrings fastened in his ears. He wore a cotton cloth all embroidered with silk, which covered him from the waist to the knees. At his side hung a dagger, the haft of which was somewhat long and all of gold, and its scabbard of carved wood. He had three spots of gold on every tooth, and his teeth appeared as if bound with gold.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r238" target="n238">238</ref></hi> He was perfumed with storax and benzoin. He was tawny and painted [<hi>i.e.</hi>, tattooed] all over. That island of his was called Butuan and Calagan.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r239" target="n239">239</ref></hi> When those kings wished to see one another, they both went to hunt in that island where we were. The name of the first king is Raia Colambu, and the second Raia Siaui.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r240" target="n240">240</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="41">Early on the morning of Sunday, the last of March, and Easter-day, the captain-general sent the priest with some men to prepare the place where mass was to be said;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r241" target="n241">241</ref></hi> together with the interpreter to tell the king that we were not going to land in order to dine with him, but to say mass. Therefore the king sent us two swine that he had had killed. When the hour for mass arrived, we landed with about fifty men, without our body armor, but carrying our other arms, and dressed in our best clothes.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r242" target="n242">242</ref></hi> Before we reached the shore with our boats, six pieces were discharged as a sign of peace. We <pb id="pb125" n="125"/>landed; the two kings embraced the captain-general, and placed him between them. We went in marching order to the place consecrated, which was not far from the shore. Before the commencement of mass, the captain sprinkled the entire bodies of the two kings with musk water.&#8221;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r243" target="n243">243</ref></hi> The mass was offered up. The kings went forward to kiss the cross as we did, but they did not offer the sacrifice.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r244" target="n244">244</ref></hi> When the body of our Lord was elevated, they remained on their knees and worshiped Him with clasped hands. The ships fired all their artillery at once when the body of Christ was elevated, the signal having been given from the shore with muskets. After the conclusion of mass, some of our men took communion.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r245" target="n245">245</ref></hi> The captain-general arranged a fencing tournament,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r246" target="n246">246</ref></hi> at which the kings were greatly pleased. Then he had a cross carried in and the nails and a crown, to which immediate reverence was made.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r247" target="n247">247</ref></hi> He told the kings through the interpreter that they were the standards given to him by the emperor his sovereign, so that wherever he might go he might set up those his tokens. [He said] that he wished to set it up in that place for their benefit, for whenever any of our ships came,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r248" target="n248">248</ref></hi> they would know that we had been there by that cross, and would do nothing to displease them or harm their property [property: <hi>doublet in original MS.</hi>]. If any of their men were captured, they would be set free immediately on that sign being shown. It was necessary to set that cross on the summit of the highest mountain, so that on seeing it every morning, they might adore it; and if they did that, neither thunder, lightning, nor storms would harm them in the least. They <pb id="pb127" n="127"/>thanked him heartily and [said] that they would do everything willingly. The captain-general also had them asked whether they were Moros or heathen, or what was their belief. They replied that they worshiped nothing, but that they raised their clasped hands and their face to the sky; and that they called their god &#8220;Abba.&#8221;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r249" target="n249">249</ref></hi> Thereat the captain was very glad, and seeing that, the first king raised his hands to the sky, and said that he wished that it were possible for him to make the captain see his love for him. The interpreter asked the king why there was so little to eat there. The latter replied that he did not live in that place except when he went hunting and to see his brother, but that he lived in another island where all his family were. The captain-general had him asked to declare whether he had any enemies, so that he might go with his ships to destroy them and to render them obedient to him.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r250" target="n250">250</ref></hi> The king thanked him and said that he did indeed have two islands hostile to him, but that it was not then the season to go there. The captain told him that if God would again allow him to return to those districts, he would bring so many men that he would make the king&#8217;s enemies subject to him by force. He said that he was about to go to dinner, and that he would return afterward to have the cross set up on the summit of the mountain. They replied that they were satisfied, and then forming in battalion and firing the muskets, and the captain having embraced the two kings, we took our leave.

 </p><p n="42">After dinner we all returned clad in our doublets, and that afternoon<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r251" target="n251">251</ref></hi> went together with the two <pb id="pb129" n="129"/>kings to the summit of the highest mountain there. When we reached the summit, the captain-general told them that he esteemed highly having sweated for them, for since the cross was there, it could not but be of great use to them. On asking them which port was the best to get food, they replied that there were three, namely, Ceylon, Zubu, and Calaghann, but that Zubu was the largest and the one with most trade. They offered of their own accord to give us pilots to show us the way. The captain-general thanked them, and determined to go there, for so did his unhappy fate will. After the cross was erected in position, each of us repeated a <hi>Pater Noster</hi> and an <hi>Ave Maria</hi>, and adored the cross; and the kings did the same. Then we descended through their cultivated fields, and went to the place where the balanghai was.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r252" target="n252">252</ref></hi> The kings had some cocoanuts brought in so that we might refresh ourselves. The captain asked the kings for the pilots for he intended to depart the following morning, and [said] that he would treat them as if they were the kings themselves, and would leave one of us as hostage. The kings replied that every hour he wished the pilots were at his command, but that night the first king changed his mind, and in the morning when we were about to depart, sent word to the captain-general, asking him for love of him to wait two days until he should have his rice harvested, and other trifles attended to. He asked the captain-general to send him some men to help him, so that it might be done sooner; and said that he intended to act as our pilot himself. The captain sent him some men, but the kings ate and drank so much <pb id="pb131" n="131"/>that they slept all the day. Some said to excuse them that they were slightly sick. Our men did nothing on that day, but they worked the next two days.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r253" target="n253">253</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="43">One of those people brought us about a porringer full of rice and also eight or ten figs [<hi>i.e.</hi>, bananas] fastened together to barter them for a knife which at the most was worth three catrini.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r254" target="n254">254</ref></hi> The captain seeing that that native cared for nothing but a knife, called him to look at other things. He put his hand in his purse and wished to give him one real for those things, but the native refused it. The captain showed him a ducado but he would not accept that either. Finally the captain tried to give him a doppione<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r255" target="n255">255</ref></hi> worth two ducados, but he would take nothing but a knife; and accordingly the captain had one given to him. When one of our men went ashore for water, one of those people wanted to give him a pointed crown of massy gold, of the size of a colona<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r256" target="n256">256</ref></hi> for six strings of glass beads, but the captain refused to let him barter, so that the natives should learn at the very beginning that we prized our merchandise more than their gold.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r257" target="n257">257</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="44">Those people are heathens,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r258" target="n258">258</ref></hi> and go naked and painted. They wear a piece of cloth woven from a tree about their privies.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r259" target="n259">259</ref></hi> They are very heavy drinkers.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r260" target="n260">260</ref></hi> Their women are clad in tree cloth from their waist down, and their hair is black and reaches to the ground. They have holes pierced in their ears which are filled with gold. Those people are constantly chewing a fruit which they call <hi>areca</hi>, and which resembles a pear. They cut that fruit into four parts, and then wrap it in the leaves <pb id="pb133" n="133"/>of their tree which they call <hi>betre</hi> [<hi>i.e.</hi>, betel]. Those leaves resemble the leaves of the mulberry. They mix it with a little lime, and when they have chewed it thoroughly, they spit it out.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r261" target="n261">261</ref></hi> It makes the mouth exceedingly red. All the people in those parts of the world use it, for it is very cooling to the heart, and if they ceased to use it they would die. There are dogs, cats, swine, fowls, goats, rice, ginger, cocoanuts, figs [<hi>i.e.</hi>, bananas], oranges, lemons, millet, panicum, sorgo,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r262" target="n262">262</ref></hi> wax, and a quantity of gold in that island. It lies in a latitude of nine and two-thirds degrees toward the Arctic Pole, and in a longitude of one hundred and sixty-two degrees from the line of demarcation. It is twenty-five from the Acquada, and is called Mazaua.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r263" target="n263">263</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="45">We remained there seven days, after which we laid our course toward the northwest, passing among<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r264" target="n264">264</ref></hi> five islands, namely, Ceylon, Bohol, Canighan, Baybai, and Gatighan.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r265" target="n265">265</ref></hi> In the last-named island of Gatigan, there are bats as large as eagles. As it was late we killed one of them,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r266" target="n266">266</ref></hi> which resembled chicken in taste. There are doves, turtledoves,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r267" target="n267">267</ref></hi> parrots, and certain black birds as large as domestic chickens, which have a long tail. The last mentioned birds lay eggs as large as the goose, and bury them under the sand, through the great heat of which they hatch out. When the chicks are born, they push up the sand, and come out. Those eggs are good to eat. There is a distance of twenty leguas from Mazaua to Gatighan. We set out westward from Gatighan, but the king of Mazaua could not follow us [closely], and consequently, we awaited him near three islands, namely, Polo, Ticobon, and <pb id="pb137" n="137"/>Pozon.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r268" target="n268">268</ref></hi> When he caught up with us he was greatly astonished at the rapidity with which we sailed. The captain-general had him come into his ship with several of his chiefs at which they were pleased. Thus did we go to Zubu from Gatighan, the distance to Zubu being fifteen leguas.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r269" target="n269">269</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="46">At noon on Sunday, April seven, we entered the port of Zubu, passing by many villages, where we saw many houses built upon logs. On approaching the city, the captain-general ordered the ships to fling their banners. The sails were lowered and arranged as if for battle, and all the artillery was fired, an action which caused great fear to those people. The captain sent a foster-son of his as ambassador to the king of Zubo with the interpreter. When they reached the city, they found a vast crowd of people together with the king, all of whom had been frightened by the mortars. The interpreter told them<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r270" target="n270">270</ref></hi> that that was our custom when entering into such places, as a sign of peace and friendship, and that we had discharged all our mortars to honor the king of the village. The king and all of his men were reassured, and the king had us asked by his governor what we wanted. The interpreter replied that his master was a captain of the greatest king and prince in the world, and that he was going to discover Malucho;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r271" target="n271">271</ref></hi> but that he had come solely to visit the king because of the good report which he had heard of him from the king of Mazaua, and to buy food with his merchandise. The king told him that he was welcome [<hi>literally</hi>: he had come at a good time], but that it was their custom for all ships that entered their ports to pay tribute, and that it <pb id="pb139" n="139"/>was but four days since a junk from Ciama [<hi>i.e.</hi>, Siam] laden with gold and slaves had paid him tribute. As proof of his statement the king pointed out to the interpreter a merchant from Ciama, who had remained to trade the gold and slaves. The interpreter told the king that, since his master was the captain of so great a king, he did not pay tribute to any seignior in the world, and that if the king wished peace he would have peace, but if war instead, war. Thereupon, the Moro merchant said to the king <hi>Cata raia chita</hi> that is to say,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r272" target="n272">272</ref></hi> &#8220;Look well, sire.&#8221; &#8220;These men are the same who have conquered Calicut, Malaca, and all India Magiore [<hi>i.e.</hi>, India Major].<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r273" target="n273">273</ref></hi> If they are treated well, they will give good treatment, but if they are treated evil, evil and worse treatment, as they have done to Calicut and Malaca.&#8221; The interpreter understood it all and told the king that his master&#8217;s king was more powerful in men and ships than the king of Portogalo, that he was the king of Spagnia and emperor of all the Christians, and that if the king did not care to be his friend<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r274" target="n274">274</ref></hi> he would next time send so many men that they would destroy him. The Moro related everything to the king,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r275" target="n275">275</ref></hi> who said thereupon that he would deliberate with his men, and would answer the captain on the following day. Then he had refreshments of many dishes, all made from meat and contained in porcelain platters, besides many jars of wine brought in. After our men had refreshed themselves, they returned and told us everything. The king of Mazaua,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r276" target="n276">276</ref></hi> who was the most influential after that king and the seignior of a number of islands, went ashore to speak to the king of the great courtesy of our captain-general.

 <pb id="pb141" n="141"/></p><p n="47">Monday morning, our notary, together with the interpreter, went to Zubu. The king, accompanied by his chiefs, came to the open square where he had our men sit down near him. He asked the notary whether there were more than one captain in that company, and whether that captain wished him to pay tribute to the emperor his master. The notary replied in the negative, but that the captain wished only to trade with him and with no others. The king said that he was satisfied, and that if the captain wished to become his friend, he should send him a drop of blood from his right arm, and he himself would do the same [to him] as a sign of the most sincere friendship.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r277" target="n277">277</ref></hi> The notary answered that the captain would do it. Thereupon, the king told him that all the captains who came to that place, were wont to give presents one to the other [<hi>i.e.</hi>, mutual presents between the king and the captain], and asked whether our captain or he ought to commence.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r278" target="n278">278</ref></hi> The interpreter told the king that since he desired to maintain the custom, he should commence, and so he did.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r279" target="n279">279</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="48">Tuesday morning the king of Mazaua came to the ships with the Moro. He saluted the captain-general in behalf of the king [of Zubu], and said that the king of Zubu was collecting as much food as possible to give to him, and that after dinner he would send one of his nephews and two others of his chief men to make peace. The captain-general had one of his men armed with his own arms, and had the Moro told that we all fought in that manner. The Moro was greatly frightened, but the captain told him not to be frightened for our arms were soft <pb id="pb143" n="143"/>toward our friends and harsh toward our enemies; and as handkerchiefs wipe off the sweat so did our arms overthrow and destroy all our adversaries, and those who hate our faith.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r280" target="n280">280</ref></hi> The captain did that so that the Moro who seemed more intelligent than the others, might tell it to the king.

 </p><p n="49">After dinner the king&#8217;s nephew, who was the prince, came to the ships with the king of Mazaua, the Moro, the governor, the chief constable, and eight chiefs, to make peace with us. The captain-general was seated in a red velvet chair, the principal men<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r281" target="n281">281</ref></hi> on leather chairs, and the others on mats upon the floor. The captain-general asked them through the interpreter whether it were their custom to speak in secret or in public, and whether that prince and the king of Mazaua had authority to make peace.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r282" target="n282">282</ref></hi> They answered that they spoke in public, and that they were empowered to make peace. The captain-general said many things concerning peace, and that he prayed God to confirm it in heaven. They said that they had never heard any one speak such words, but that they took great pleasure in hearing them. The captain seeing that they listened and answered willingly, began to advance arguments to induce them to accept the faith. Asking them who would succeed to the seigniory after the death of the king, he was answered that the king had no sons but only daughters, the eldest of whom was the wife of that nephew of his, who therefore was the prince. [They said that] when the fathers and mothers grew old, they received no further honor, but their children commanded them. The captain told them that God made the sky, the earth, the sea, and everything else, <pb id="pb145" n="145"/>and that He had commanded us to honor our fathers and mothers, and that whoever did otherwise was condemned to eternal fire; that we are all descended from Adam and Eva, our first parents; that we have an immortal spirit;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r283" target="n283">283</ref></hi> and many other things pertaining to the faith. All joyfully entreated the captain to leave them two men, or at least one,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r284" target="n284">284</ref></hi> to instruct them in the faith, and [said] that they would show them great honor. The captain replied to them that he could not leave them any men then, but that if they wished to become Christians, our priest would baptize them, and that he would next time bring priests and friars who would instruct them in our faith. They answered that they would first speak to their king, and that then they would become Christians, [whereat] we all wept with great joy. The captain-general told them that they should not become Christians for fear or to please us, but of their own free wills;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r285" target="n285">285</ref></hi> and that he would not cause any displeasure to those who wished to live according to their own law, but that the Christians would be better regarded and treated than the others. All cried out with one voice that they were not becoming Christians through fear or to please us, but of their own free will. Then the captain told them that if they became Christians, he would leave a suit of armor,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r286" target="n286">286</ref></hi> for so had his king commanded him; that we could not have intercourse with their women without committing a very great, sin, since they were pagans; and that he assured them that if they became Christians, the devil would no longer appear to them except in the last moment at their death.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r287" target="n287">287</ref></hi> They said that they could not answer the beautiful words of the <pb id="pb147" n="147"/>captain, but that they placed themselves in his hands, and that he should treat them as his most faithful servants. The captain embraced them weeping, and clasping one of the prince&#8217;s hands and one of the king&#8217;s between his own, said to them that, by his faith in God and to his sovereign, the emperor, and by the habit which he wore,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r288" target="n288">288</ref></hi> he promised them that he would give them perpetual peace with the king of Spagnia. They answered that they promised the same. After the conclusion of the peace, the captain had refreshments served to them. Then the prince and the king [of Mazaua] presented some baskets of rice, swine, goats, and fowls to the captain-general on behalf of their king, and asked him to pardon them, for such things were but little [to give] to one such as he. The captain gave the prince a white cloth of the finest linen, a red cap, some strings of glass beads, and a gilded glass drinking cup. Those glasses are greatly appreciated in those districts. He did not give any present to the king of Mazaua, for he had already given him a robe of Cambaya, besides other articles.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r289" target="n289">289</ref></hi> To the others he gave now one thing and now another. Then he sent to the king of Zubu through me and one other a yellow and violet silk robe, made in Turkish style, a fine red cap, some strings of glass beads, all in a silver dish, and two gilt drinking cups in our hands.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r290" target="n290">290</ref></hi> When we reached the city we found the king in his palace surrounded by many people. He was seated on a palm mat on the ground, with only a cotton cloth before his privies, and a scarf embroidered with the needle about his head, a necklace of great value hanging from his neck, and two large gold earrings fastened in his ears set round <pb id="pb149" n="149"/>with precious gems. He was fat and short, and tattooed with fire<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r291" target="n291">291</ref></hi> in various designs. From another mat on the ground he was eating turtle eggs which were in two porcelain dishes, and he had four jars full of palm wine in front of him covered with sweet-smelling herbs and arranged with four small reeds in each jar by means of which he drank.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r292" target="n292">292</ref></hi> Having duly made reverence to him, the interpreter told the king that his master thanked him very warmly for his present, and that he sent this present not in return for his present but for the intrinsic love which he bore him.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r293" target="n293">293</ref></hi> We dressed him in the robe, placed the cap on his head, and gave him the other things; then kissing the beads and putting them upon his head, I presented them to him. He doing the same [<hi>i.e.</hi>, kissing them] accepted them. Then the king had us eat some of those eggs and drink through those slender reeds. The others, his men, told him in that place, the words of the captain concerning peace and his exhortation to them to become Christians. The king wished to have us stay to supper with him, but we told him that we could not stay then. Having taken our leave of him, the prince took us with him to his house, where four young girls were playing [instruments]&#8212;one, on a drum like ours, but resting on the ground; the second was striking two suspended gongs alternately with a stick wrapped somewhat thickly at the end with palm cloth; the third, one large gong in the same manner; and the last, two small gongs held in her hand, by striking one against the other, which gave forth a sweet sound. They played so harmoniously that one would believe they possessed good musical sense. <pb id="pb151" n="151"/>Those girls were very beautiful and almost as white as our girls and as large. They were naked except for tree cloth hanging from the waist and reaching to the knees. Some were quite naked and had large holes in their ears with a small round piece of wood in the hole, which keeps the hole round and large. They have long black hair, and wear a short cloth about the head, and are always barefoot. The prince had three quite naked girls dance for us. We took refreshments and then went to the ships. Those gongs are made of brass [<hi>metalo</hi>] and are manufactured in the regions about the Signio Magno<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r294" target="n294">294</ref></hi> which is called China. They are used in those regions as we use bells and are called <hi>aghon</hi>.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r295" target="n295">295</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="50">On Wednesday morning, as one of our men had died during the previous night, the interpreter and I<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r296" target="n296">296</ref></hi> went to ask the king where we could bury him. We found the king surrounded by many men, of whom, after the due reverence was made, I asked it.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r297" target="n297">297</ref></hi> He replied, &#8220;If I and my vassals all belong to your sovereign, how much more ought the land.&#8221; I told the king that we would like to consecrate the place,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r298" target="n298">298</ref></hi> and to set up a cross there. He replied that he was quite satisfied, and that he wished to adore the cross as did we. The deceased was buried in the square with as much pomp as possible, in order to furnish a good example. Then we consecrated the place, and in the evening buried another man. We carried a quantity of merchandise ashore which we stored in a house. The king took it under his care as well as four men who were left to trade the goods by wholesale.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r299" target="n299">299</ref></hi> Those people live in accordance with justice, and have weights and measures. They love <pb id="pb153" n="153"/>peace, ease, and quiet. They have wooden balances, the bar of which has a cord in the middle by which it is held. At one end is a bit of lead, and at the other marks like quarter-libras, third-libras, and libras. When they wish to weigh they take the scales which has three wires like ours, and place it above the marks, and so weigh accurately.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r300" target="n300">300</ref></hi> They have very large measures without any bottom.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r301" target="n301">301</ref></hi> The youth play on pipes made like ours which they call <hi>subin</hi>. Their houses are constructed of wood, and are built of planks and bamboo, raised high from the ground on large logs, and one must enter them by means of ladders. They have rooms like ours; and under the house they keep their swine, goats, and fowls. Large sea snails [<hi>corniolli</hi>], beautiful to the sight, are found there which kill whales. For the whale swallows them alive, and when they are in the whale&#8217;s body, they come out of their shells and eat the whale&#8217;s heart. Those people afterward find them alive near the dead whale&#8217;s heart. Those creatures have black teeth and skin and a white shell, and the flesh is good to eat. They are called <hi>laghan</hi>.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r302" target="n302">302</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="51">On Friday we showed those people a shop full of our merchandise,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r303" target="n303">303</ref></hi> at which they were very much surprised. For metals, iron, and other large merchandise they gave us gold. For the other smaller articles they gave us rice, swine, goats, and other food. Those people gave us x pieces of gold for xiiii libras of iron<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r304" target="n304">304</ref></hi> (one piece being worth about one and one-half ducados). The captain-general did not wish to take too much gold, for there would have been some sailors who would have given all that they owned for a small amount of gold, and would have <pb id="pb155" n="155"/>spoiled the trade for ever.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r305" target="n305">305</ref></hi> On Saturday, as the captain had promised the king to make him a Christian on Sunday, a platform was built in the consecrated square, which was adorned with hangings and palm branches for his baptism. The captain-general sent men to tell the king not to be afraid of the pieces that would be discharged in the morning, for it was our custom to discharge them at our greatest feasts without loading with stones.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r306" target="n306">306</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="52">On Sunday morning, April fourteen, forty men of us went ashore, two of whom were completely armed and preceded the royal banner.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r307" target="n307">307</ref></hi> When we reached land all the artillery was fired.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r308" target="n308">308</ref></hi> Those people followed us hither and thither. The captain and the king embraced. The captain told the king that the royal banner was not taken ashore except with fifty men armed as were those two, and with fifty musketeers; but so great was his love for him that he had thus brought the banner.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r309" target="n309">309</ref></hi> Then we all approached the platform joyfully. The captain and the king sat down in chairs of red and violet velvet,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r310" target="n310">310</ref></hi> the chiefs on cushions, and the others on mats.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r311" target="n311">311</ref></hi> The captain told the king through the interpreter that he thanked God for inspiring him to became a Christian; and that [now] he would more easily conquer his enemies than before. The king replied that he wished to become a Christian, but that some of his chiefs did not wish to obey, because they said that they were as good men as he. Then our captain had all the chiefs of the king called, and told them that, unless they obeyed the king as their king, he would have them killed, and would give their possessions to the king. They replied that they would <pb id="pb157" n="157"/>obey him. The captain told the king that he was going to Spagnia, but that he would return again with so many forces that he would make him the greatest king of those regions, as he had been the first to express a determination to become a Christian. The king, lifting his hands to the sky, thanked the captain, and requested him to let some of his men remain [with him], so that he and his people might be better instructed in the faith. The captain replied that he would leave two men to satisfy him, but that he would like to take two of the children of the chiefs with him, so that they might learn our language, who afterward on their return would be able to tell the others the wonders [<hi>cose</hi>] of Spagnia. A large cross was set up in the middle of the square. The captain told them that if they wished to become Christians as they had declared on the previous days, that they must burn all their idols and set up a cross in their place. They were to adore that cross daily with clasped hands, and every morning after their [<hi>i.e.</hi>, the Spaniards&#8217;] custom, they were to make the sign of the cross (which the captain showed them how to make); and they ought to come hourly, at least in the morning, to that cross, and adore it kneeling. The intention that they had already declared, they were to confirm with good works. The king and all the others wished to confirm it thoroughly. The captain-general told the king that he was clad all in white to demonstrate his sincere love toward them. They replied that they could not respond to his sweet words. The captain led the king by the hand to the platform while speaking these good words in order to baptize him. He told the king <pb id="pb159" n="159"/>that he would call him Don Carlo, after his sovereign the emperor; the prince, Don Fernando, after the emperor&#8217;s brother; the king of Mazaua, Johanni; a chief, Fernando, after our chief, that is to say, the captain; the Moro, Christoforo; and then the others, now one name, and now another. Five hundred men were baptized before mass. After the conclusion of mass, the captain invited the king and some of the other chiefs to dinner, but they refused, accompanying us, however, to the shore. The ships discharged all the mortars; and embracing, the king and chiefs and the captain took leave of one another.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r312" target="n312">312</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="53">After dinner the priest and some of the others went ashore to baptize the queen, who came with forty women. We conducted her to the platform, and she was made to sit down upon a cushion, and the other women near her, until the priest should be ready. She was shown an image of our Lady, a very beautiful wooden child Jesus, and a cross. Thereupon, she was overcome with contrition, and asked for baptism amid her tears.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r313" target="n313">313</ref></hi> We named her Johanna, after the emperor&#8217;s mother; her daughter, the wife of the prince, Catherina; the queen of Mazaua, Lisabeta; and the others, each their [distinctive] name. Counting men, women, and children, we baptized eight hundred souls.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r314" target="n314">314</ref></hi> The queen was young and beautiful, and was entirely covered with a white and black cloth. Her mouth and nails were very red, while on her head she wore a large hat of palm leaves in the manner of a parasol,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r315" target="n315">315</ref></hi> with a crown about it of the same leaves, like the tiara of the pope; and she never goes any place without such a one.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r316" target="n316">316</ref></hi> She asked us to give her the little child <pb id="pb161" n="161"/>Jesus to keep in place of her idols;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r317" target="n317">317</ref></hi> and then she went away. In the afternoon,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r318" target="n318">318</ref></hi> the king and queen, accompanied by numerous persons, came to the shore. Thereupon, the captain had many trombs of fire and large mortars discharged, by which they were most highly delighted.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r319" target="n319">319</ref></hi> The captain and the king called one another brothers. That king&#8217;s name was Raia Humabon. Before that week had gone, all the persons of that island, and some from the other island, were baptized. We burned one hamlet which was located in a neighboring island, because it refused to obey the king or us. We set up the cross there for those people were heathen. Had they been Moros, we would have erected a column there as a token of greater hardness, for the Moros are much harder to convert than the heathen.

 </p><p n="54">The captain-general went ashore daily during those days to hear mass, and told the king many things regarding the faith.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r320" target="n320">320</ref></hi> One day the queen came with great pomp to hear mass. Three girls preceded her with three of her hats in their hands.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r321" target="n321">321</ref></hi> She was dressed in black and white with a large silk scarf, crossed with gold stripes thrown over her head, which covered her shoulders; and she had on her hat. A great number of women accompanied her, who were all naked and barefoot, except that they had a small covering of palm-tree cloth before their privies, and a small scarf upon the head, and all with hair flowing free. The queen, having made the due reverence to the altar, seated herself on a silk embroidered cushion. Before the commencement of the mass, the captain sprayed her and some of her women with musk rosewater, for they delighted exceedingly <pb id="pb163" n="163"/>in such perfumes. The captain knowing that the queen was very much pleased with the child Jesus, gave it to her, telling her to keep it in place of her idols, for it was in memory<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r322" target="n322">322</ref></hi> of the son of God. Thanking him heartily she accepted it.

 </p><p n="55">Before mass one day, the captain-general had the king come clad in his silk robe, and the chief men of the city, [to wit], the king&#8217;s brother and prince&#8217;s father, whose name was Bendara; another of the king&#8217;s brothers, Cadaio; and certain ones called Simiut, Sibuaia, Sisacai, Maghalibe, and many others whom I shall not name in order not to be tedious.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r323" target="n323">323</ref></hi> The captain made them all swear to be obedient to their king, and they kissed the latter&#8217;s hand. Then the captain had the king declare that he would always be obedient and faithful to the king of Spagnia, and the king so swore.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r324" target="n324">324</ref></hi> Thereupon, the captain drew his Sword before the image of our Lady, and told the king that when anyone so swore, he should prefer to die rather than to break such an oath,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r325" target="n325">325</ref></hi> if he swore by that image, by the life of the emperor his sovereign, and by his habit to be ever faithful. After the conclusion of that the captain gave the king a red velvet chair, telling him that wherever he went he should always have it carried before him by one of his nearest relatives; and he showed him how it ought to be carried. The king responded that he would do that willingly for love of him, and he told the captain that he was making a jewel to give to him, namely, two large earrings of gold to fasten<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r326" target="n326">326</ref></hi> in his ears, two armlets to put on his arms, above the elbows, and two other rings for the feet above the ankles, besides other precious <pb id="pb165" n="165"/>gems to adorn<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r327" target="n327">327</ref></hi> the ears. Those are the most beautiful ornaments which the kings of those districts can wear. They always go barefoot, and wear a cloth garment that hangs from the waist to the knees.

 </p><p n="56">One day the captain-general asked the king and the other people why they did not burn their idols as they had promised when they became Christians; and why they sacrificed so much flesh to them. They replied that what they were doing was not for themselves, but for a sick man who had not spoken now for four days, so that the idols might give him health. He was the prince&#8217;s brother, and the bravest and wisest man in the island. The captain told them to burn their idols and to believe in Christ, and that if the sick man were baptized, he would quickly recover; and if that did not so happen they could behead him [<hi>i.e.</hi>, the captain] then and there. Thereupon, the king replied that he would do it, for he truly believed in Christ. We made a procession from the square to the house of the sick man with as much pomp as possible. There we found him in such condition that he could neither speak nor move. We baptized him and his two wives, and x girls. Then the captain had him asked how he felt. He spoke immediately and said that by the grace of our Lord he felt very well. That was a most manifest miracle [that happened] in our times. When the captain heard him speak, he thanked God fervently. Then he made the sick man drink some almond milk, which he had already had made for him. Afterward he sent him a mattress, a pair of sheets, a coverlet of yellow cloth, and a pillow. Until he recovered his health, the captain sent him almond milk, rosewater, <pb id="pb167" n="167"/>oil of roses, and some sweet preserves. Before five days the sick man began to walk. He had an idol that certain old women had concealed in his house burned in the presence of the king and all the people. He had many shrines along the seashore destroyed,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r328" target="n328">328</ref></hi> in which the consecrated meat was eaten. The people themselves cried out &#8220;Castiglia! Castiglia!&#8221; and destroyed<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r329" target="n329">329</ref></hi> those shrines. They said that if God would lend them life, they would burn all the idols that they could find, even if they were in the king&#8217;s house. Those idols are made of wood, and are hollow, and lack the back parts. Their arms are open and their feet turned up under them with the legs open. They have a large face with four huge tusks like those of the wild boar; and are painted all over.

 </p><p n="57">There are many villages in that island. Their names, those of their inhabitants, and of their chiefs are as follows: Cinghapola, and its chiefs, Cilaton, Ciguibucan, Cimaningha, Cimatichat, and Cicanbul; one, Mandaui, and its chief, Apanoaan; one Lalan, and its chief, Theteu; one, Lalutan, and its chief, Tapan; one Cilumai; and one, Lubucun.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r330" target="n330">330</ref></hi> All those villages rendered obedience to us, and gave us food and tribute. Near that island of Zubu was an island called Matan, which formed the port where we were anchored. The name of its village was Matan, and its chiefs were Zula and Cilapulapu. That city which we burned was in that island and was called Bulaia.

 </p><p n="58">In order that your most illustrious Lordship may know the ceremonies that those people use in consecrating the swine, they first sound those large <pb id="pb169" n="169"/>gongs.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r331" target="n331">331</ref></hi> Then three large dishes are brought in; two with roses and with cakes of rice and millet, baked and wrapped in leaves, and roast fish; the other with cloth of Cambaia<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r332" target="n332">332</ref></hi> and two standards made of palm-tree cloth. One bit of cloth of Cambaia is spread on the ground. Then two very old women come, each of whom has a bamboo trumpet in her hand. When they have stepped upon the cloth they make obeisance to the sun. Then they wrap the cloths about themselves. One of them puts a kerchief with two horns on her forehead, and takes another kerchief in her hands, and dancing and blowing upon her trumpet, she thereby calls out to the sun. The other takes one of the standards and dances and blows on her trumpet. They dance and call out thus for a little space, saying many things between themselves to the sun. She with the kerchief takes the other standard, and lets the kerchief drop, and both blowing on their trumpets for a long time, dance about the bound hog. She with the horns always speaks covertly to the sun, and the other answers her. A cup of wine is presented to her of the horns, and she dancing and repeating certain words, while the other answers her, and making pretense four or five times of drinking the wine, sprinkles it upon the heart of the hog. Then she immediately begins to dance again. A lance is given to the same woman. She shaking it and repeating certain words, while both of them continue to dance, and making motions four or five times of thrusting the lance through the heart of the hog, with a sudden and quick stroke, thrusts it through from one side to the other. The wound is quickly stopped<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r333" target="n333">333</ref></hi> with <pb id="pb171" n="171"/>grass. The one who has killed the hog, taking in her mouth a lighted torch, which has been lighted throughout that ceremony, extinguishes it.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r334" target="n334">334</ref></hi> The other one dipping the end of her trumpet in the blood of the hog, goes around marking with blood with her finger first the foreheads of their husbands, and then the others; but they never came to us. Then they divest themselves and go to eat the contents of those dishes, and they invite only women [to eat with them]. The hair is removed from the hog by means of fire. Thus no one but old women consecrate the flesh of the hog, and they do not eat it unless it is killed in this way.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r335" target="n335">335</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="59">Those people go naked, wearing but one piece of palm-tree cloth about<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r336" target="n336">336</ref></hi> their privies. The males, large and small, have their penis pierced from one side to the other near the head, with a gold or tin bolt as large as a goose quill. In both ends of the same bolt, some have what resembles a spur, with points upon the ends; others are like the head of a cart nail. I very often asked many, both old and young, to see their penis, because I could not credit it. In the middle of the bolt is a hole, through which they urinate. The bolt and the spurs always hold firm. They say that their women wish it so, and that if they did otherwise they would not have communication with them. When the men wish to have communication with their women, the latter themselves take the penis not in the regular way and commence very gently to introduce it [into their vagina], with the spur on top first, and then the other part. When it is inside it takes its regular position; and thus the penis always stays inside until it gets soft, for otherwise <pb id="pb173" n="173"/>they could not pull it out. Those people make use of that device because they are of a weak nature. They have as many wives as they wish, but one of them is the principal wife.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r337" target="n337">337</ref></hi> Whenever any of our men went ashore, both by day and by night, every one invited him to eat and to drink. Their viands are half cooked and very salty. They drink frequently and copiously from the jars<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r338" target="n338">338</ref></hi> through those small reeds, and one of their meals lasts for five or six hours. The women loved us very much more than their own men. All of the women from the age of six years and upward, have their vaginas [<hi>natura</hi>] gradually opened because of the men&#8217;s penises.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r339" target="n339">339</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="60">They practice the following ceremonies when one of their chiefs dies. First all the chief<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r340" target="n340">340</ref></hi> women of the place go to the house of the deceased. The deceased is placed in the middle of the house in a box. Ropes are placed about the box in the manner of a palisade, to which many branches of trees are attached. In the middle of each branch hangs a cotton cloth like a curtained canopy. The most principal women sit under those hangings, and are all covered with white cotton cloth, each one by a girl who fans her with a palm-leaf fan. The other women sit about the room sadly.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r341" target="n341">341</ref></hi> Then there is one woman who cuts off the hair of the deceased very slowly with a knife. Another who was the principal wife of the deceased, lies down upon him, and places her mouth, her hands, and her feet upon those of the deceased. When the former is cutting off the hair, the latter weeps; and when the former finishes the cutting, the latter sings. There are many <pb id="pb175" n="175"/>porcelain jars containing fire about the room, and myrrh, storax, and bezoin, which make a strong odor through the house, are put on the fire. They keep the body in the house for five or six days during those ceremonies. I believe that the body is anointed with camphor. Then they bury the body and the same box which is shut in a log by means of wooden nails and covered and enclosed by logs of wood.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r342" target="n342">342</ref></hi> Every night about midnight in that city, a jet black bird as large as a crow was wont to come, and no sooner had it thus reached the houses than it began to screech, so that all the dogs began to howl; and that screeching and howling would last for four or five hours,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r343" target="n343">343</ref></hi> but those people would never tell us the reason of it.

 </p><p n="61">On Friday, April twenty-six, Zula, a chief of the island of Matan,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r344" target="n344">344</ref></hi> sent one of his sons to present two goats to the captain-general, and to say that he would send him all that he had promised, but that he had not been able to send it to him because of the other chief Cilapulapu, who refused to obey the king of Spagnia. He requested the captain to send him only one boatload of men on the next night, so that they might help him and fight against the other chief. The captain-general decided to go thither with three boatloads. We begged him repeatedly not to go, but he, like a good shepherd, refused to abandon his flock. At midnight, sixty men of us set out armed with corselets and helmets, together with the Christian king, the prince, some of the chief men, and twenty or thirty balanguais. We reached Matan three hours before dawn. The captain did not wish to fight then, but sent a message to the natives by the Moro to the effect that if they would obey the king <pb id="pb177" n="177"/>of Spagnia, recognize the Christian king as their sovereign, and pay us our tribute, he would be their friend; but that if they wished otherwise, they should wait to see how our lances wounded.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r345" target="n345">345</ref></hi> They replied that if we had lances they had lances of bamboo and stakes hardened with fire. [They asked us] not to proceed to attack them at once, but to wait until morning, so that they might have more men. They said that in order to induce us to go in search of them; for they had dug certain pitholes between the houses in order that we might fall into them. When morning came forty-nine of us leaped into the water up to our thighs, and walked through water for more than two crossbow flights before we could reach the shore. The boats could not approach nearer because of certain rocks in the water. The other eleven men remained behind to guard the boats. When we reached land, those men had formed in three divisions to the number of more than one thousand five hundred persons. When they saw us, they charged down upon us with exceeding loud cries, two divisions on our flanks and the other on our front. When the captain saw that, he formed us into two divisions, and thus did we begin to fight. The musketeers and crossbowmen shot from a distance for about a half-hour, but uselessly; for the shots only passed through the shields which were made of thin wood and the arms [of the bearers]. The captain cried to them, &#8220;Cease firing! cease firing!&#8221; but his order was not at all heeded. When the natives saw that we were shooting our muskets to no purpose, crying out they determined to stand firm, but they redoubled their shouts. When our muskets were discharged, the natives <pb id="pb179" n="179"/>would never stand still, but leaped hither and thither, covering themselves with their shields. They shot so many arrows at us and hurled so many bamboo spears (some of them tipped with iron) at the captain-general, besides pointed stakes hardened with fire, stones, and mud, that we could scarcely defend ourselves. Seeing that the captain-general sent some men to burn their houses in order to terrify them. When they saw their houses burning, they were roused to greater fury. Two of our men were killed near the houses, while we burned twenty or thirty houses. So many of them charged down upon us that they shot the captain through the right leg with a poisoned arrow. On that account, he ordered us to retire slowly, but the men took to flight, except six or eight of us who remained with the captain. The natives shot only at our legs, for the latter were bare; and so many were the spears and stones that they hurled at us, that we could offer no resistance. The mortars in the boats could not aid us as they were too far away. So we continued to retire for more than a good crossbow flight from the shore always fighting up to our knees in the water. The natives continued to pursue us, and picking up the same spear four or six times, hurled it at us again and again. Recognizing the captain, so many turned upon him that they knocked his helmet off his head twice, but he always stood firmly like a good knight, together with some others. Thus did we fight for more than one hour, refusing to retire farther. An Indian hurled a bamboo spear into the captain&#8217;s face, but the latter immediately killed him with his lance, which he left in the Indian&#8217;s body. Then, trying <pb id="pb181" n="181"/>to lay hand on sword, he could draw it out but halfway, because he had been wounded in the arm with a bamboo spear. When the natives saw that, they all hurled themselves upon him. One of them wounded him on the left leg with a large cutlass,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r346" target="n346">346</ref></hi> which resembles a scimitar, only being larger. That caused the captain to fall face downward, when immediately they rushed upon him with iron and bamboo spears and with their cutlasses, until they killed our mirror, our light, our comfort, and our true guide. When they wounded him, he turned back many times to see whether we were all in the boats. Thereupon, beholding him dead, we, wounded, retreated, as best we could, to the boats, which were already pulling off. The Christian king would have aided us, but the captain charged him before we landed, not to leave his balanghai, but to stay to see how we fought. When the king learned that the captain was dead, he wept. Had it not been for that unfortunate captain, not a single one of us would have been saved in the boats, for while he was fighting the others retired to the boats. I hope through [the efforts of] your most illustrious Lordship that the fame of so noble a captain will not become effaced in our times. Among the other virtues which he possessed, he was more constant than ever any one else in the greatest of adversity. He endured hunger better than all the others, and more accurately than any man in the world did he understand sea charts<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r347" target="n347">347</ref></hi> and navigation. And that this was the truth was seen openly, for no other had had so much natural talent <pb id="pb183" n="183"/>nor the boldness to learn how to circumnavigate the world, as he had almost done. That battle was fought on Saturday, April twenty-seven, 1521.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r348" target="n348">348</ref></hi> The captain desired to fight on Saturday, because it was the day especially holy to him. Eight of our men were killed with him in that battle,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r349" target="n349">349</ref></hi> and four Indians, who had become Christians and who had come afterward to aid us were killed by the mortars of the boats. Of the enemy, only fifteen were killed, while many of us were wounded.

 </p><p n="62">In the afternoon the Christian king sent a message with our consent to the people of Matan, to the effect that if they would give us the captain and the other men who had been killed, we would give them as much merchandise as they wished. They answered that they would not give up such a man, as we imagined [they would do], and that they would not give him for all the riches in the world, but that they intended to keep him as a memorial.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r350" target="n350">350</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="63">On Saturday, the day on which the captain was killed, the four men who had remained in the city to trade, had our merchandise carried to the ships. Then we chose two commanders, namely, Duarte Barboza,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r351" target="n351">351</ref></hi> a Portuguese and a relative of the captain, and Johan Seranno, a Spaniard.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r352" target="n352">352</ref></hi> As our interpreter, Henrich by name, was wounded slightly, he would not go ashore any more to attend to our necessary affairs, but always kept his bed. On that account, Duarte Barboza, the commander of the flagship, cried out to him and told him, that although his master, the captain, was dead, he was not therefore free; on the contrary he [<hi>i.e.</hi>, Barboza] would see <pb id="pb185" n="185"/>to it that when we should reach Espagnia, he should still be the slave of Do&#241;a Beatrice, the wife of the captain-general.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r353" target="n353">353</ref></hi> And threatening the slave that if he did go ashore, he would be flogged, the latter arose, and, feigning to take no heed to those words, went ashore to tell the Christian king<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r354" target="n354">354</ref></hi> that we were about to leave very soon, but that if he would follow his advice, he could gain the ships and all our merchandise. Accordingly they arranged a plot, and the slave returned to the ship, where he showed that he was more cunning<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r355" target="n355">355</ref></hi> than before.

 </p><p n="64">On Wednesday morning, the first of May, the Christian king sent word to the commanders that the jewels<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r356" target="n356">356</ref></hi> which he had promised to send to the king of Spagnia were ready, and that he begged them and their other companions to come to dine with him that morning, when he would give them the jewels. Twenty-four men went ashore, among whom was our astrologer, San Mart&#237;n de Sivilla. I could not go because I was all swollen up by a wound from a poisoned arrow which I had received in my face. Jovan Carvaio and the constable<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r357" target="n357">357</ref></hi> returned, and told us that they saw the man who had been cured by a miracle take the priest to his house.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r358" target="n358">358</ref></hi> Consequently, they had left that place, because they suspected some evil. Scarcely had they spoken those words when we heard loud cries and lamentations. We immediately weighed anchor and discharging many mortars into the houses, drew in nearer to the shore. While thus discharging [our pieces] we saw Johan Seranno in his shirt bound and wounded, crying to us not to fire any more, for the natives would kill <pb id="pb187" n="187"/>him.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r359" target="n359">359</ref></hi> We asked him whether all the others and the interpreter were dead. He said that they were all dead except the interpreter. He begged us earnestly to redeem him with some of the merchandise; but Johan Carvaio, his boon companion, [and others] would not allow the boat to go ashore so that they might remain masters of the ships.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r360" target="n360">360</ref></hi> But although Johan Serrano weeping asked us not to set sail so quickly, for they would kill him, and said that he prayed God to ask his soul of Johan Carvaio, his comrade, in the day of judgment, we immediately departed. I do not know whether he is dead or alive.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r361" target="n361">361</ref></hi>

Its name is Zubu. We heard of Malucho there before the death of the captain-general. Those people play a violin with copper strings.

 </p><p n="68">In the midst of that archipelago,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r377" target="n377">377</ref></hi> at a distance of eighteen leguas from that island of Zzubu, at the head of the other island called Bohol, we burned the ship &#8220;Conceptione,&#8221; for too few men of us were left [to work it].<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r378" target="n378">378</ref></hi> We stowed the best of its contents in the other two ships, and the laid our course toward the south southwest, coasting along the island called Panilongon,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r379" target="n379">379</ref></hi> where black men like those in Etiopia live. Then we came to a large island [Mindanao], whose king in order to make peace with us, drew blood from his left hand marking his body, face, and the tip of his tongue with it as a token of the closest friendship, and we did the same. I went ashore alone with the king in order to see that island. We had no sooner entered a river than many fishermen offered fish to the king. Then the king removed the cloths which covered his privies, as did some of his chiefs; and began to row while singing past many dwellings which were upon the river. Two hours after nightfall we reached the king&#8217;s house. The distance from the beginning of the river where our ships were to the king&#8217;s house, was two leguas. When we entered the house, we came upon many torches of cane and palm leaves,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r380" target="n380">380</ref></hi> which were of the <hi>anime</hi>, <pb id="pb203" n="203"/>of which mention was made above. Until the supper was brought in, the king with two of his chiefs and two of his beautiful women drank the contents of a large jar of palm wine without eating anything. I, excusing myself as I had supped, would only drink but once. In drinking they observed all the same ceremonies that the king of Mazaua did. Then the supper, which consisted of rice and very salt<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r381" target="n381">381</ref></hi> fish, and was contained in porcelain dishes, was brought in. They ate their rice as if it were bread, and cook it after the following manner. They first put in an earthen jar like our jars, a large leaf which lines all of the jar. Then they add the water and the rice, and after covering it allow it to boil until the rice becomes as hard as bread, when it is taken out in pieces. Rice is cooked in the same way throughout those districts.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r382" target="n382">382</ref></hi> When we had eaten, the king had a reed mat and another of palm leaves, and a leaf pillow brought in so that I might sleep on them. The king and his two women went to sleep in a separate place, while I slept with one of his chiefs.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r383" target="n383">383</ref></hi> When day came and until the dinner was brought in, I walked about that island. I saw many articles of gold in those houses<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r384" target="n384">384</ref></hi> but little food. After that we dined on rice and fish, and at the conclusion of dinner, I asked the king by signs whether I could see the queen. He replied that he was willing, and we went together to the summit of a lofty hill, where the queen&#8217;s house was located. When I entered the house, I made a bow to the queen, and she did the same to me, whereupon I sat down beside her. She was making a sleeping mat of palm leaves. In the house there was hanging a number of porcelain jars <pb id="pb205" n="205"/>and four metal gongs&#8212;one of which was larger than the second, while the other two were still smaller&#8212;for playing upon. There were many male and female slaves who served her. Those houses are constructed like those already mentioned. Having taken our leave, we returned to the king&#8217;s house, where the king had us immediately served with refreshments of sugarcane. The most abundant product of that island is gold. They showed me certain large valleys,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r385" target="n385">385</ref></hi> making me a sign that the gold there was as abundant as the hairs of their heads, but they have no iron with which to dig it, and they do not dare to go to the trouble [to get it].<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r386" target="n386">386</ref></hi> That part of the island belongs to the same land as Butuan and Calaghan, and lies toward Bohol, and is bounded by Mazaua. As we shall return to that island again, I shall say nothing further [now]. The afternoon having waned, I desired to return to the ships. The king and the other chief men wished to accompany me, and therefore we went in the same balanghai.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r387" target="n387">387</ref></hi> As we were returning along the river, I saw, on the summit of a hill at the right, three men suspended from one tree, the branches of which had been cut away. I asked the king what was the reason for that, and he replied that they were malefactors and robbers. Those people go naked as do the others above mentioned. The king&#8217;s name is Raia Calanao.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r388" target="n388">388</ref></hi> The harbor is an excellent one. Rice, ginger, swine, goats, fowls, and other things are to be found there. That port lies in a latitude of eight degrees toward the Arctic Pole, and in a longitude of one hundred and sixty-seven degrees<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r389" target="n389">389</ref></hi> from the line of demarcation. It is fifty leguas from Zubu, <pb id="pb207" n="207"/>and is called Chipit.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r390" target="n390">390</ref></hi> Two days&#8217; journey thence to the northwest is found a large island called Lozon,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r391" target="n391">391</ref></hi> where six or eight junks belonging to the Lequian people go yearly.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r392" target="n392">392</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="69">Leaving there and laying our course west southwest, we cast anchor at an island not very large and almost uninhabited. The people of that island are Moros and were banished from an island called Burne. They go naked as do the others. They have blowpipes and small quivers at their side, full of arrows and a poisonous herb. They have daggers whose hafts are adorned with gold and precious gems, spears, bucklers, and small cuirasses of buffalo horn.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r393" target="n393">393</ref></hi> They called us holy beings. Little food was to be found in that island, but [there were] immense trees. It lies in a latitude of seven and one-half degrees toward the Arctic Pole, and is forty-three leguas<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r394" target="n394">394</ref></hi> from Chippit. Its name is Caghaian.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r395" target="n395">395</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="70">About twenty-five leguas to the west northwest from the above island we found a large island, where rice, ginger, swine, goats, fowls, figs one-half braza long and as thick as the arm [<hi>i.e.</hi>, bananas] (they are excellent; and certain others are one palmo and less in length, and are much better than all the others), cocoanuts, camotes [<hi>batate</hi>], sugarcane, and roots resembling turnips in taste, are found. Rice is cooked there under the fire in bamboos or in wood; and it lasts better than that cooked in earthen pots. We called that land the land of promise, because we suffered great hunger before we found it. We were often on the point of abandoning the ships and going ashore in order that we might not die of hunger.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r396" target="n396">396</ref></hi> <pb id="pb211" n="211"/>The king made peace with us by gashing himself slightly in the breast with one of our knives, and upon bleeding, touching the tip of his tongue and his forehead in token of the truest peace, and we did the same. That island lies in a latitude of nine and one-third degrees toward the Arctic Pole, and a longitude of one hundred and seventy-one and one-third<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r397" target="n397">397</ref></hi> degrees from the line of demarcation. [It is called] Pulaoan.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r398" target="n398">398</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="71">Those people of Polaoan go naked as do the others. Almost all<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r399" target="n399">399</ref></hi> of them cultivate their fields. They have blowpipes with thick wooden arrows more than one palmo long, with harpoon points, and others tipped with fishbones, and poisoned with an herb; while others are tipped with points of bamboo like harpoons and are poisoned.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r400" target="n400">400</ref></hi> At the end of the arrow they attach a little piece of soft wood, instead of feathers. At the end of their blowpipes they fasten a bit of iron like a spear head;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r401" target="n401">401</ref></hi> and when they have shot all their arrows they fight with that. They place a value on brass rings and chains, bells, knives, and still more on copper wire for binding their fishhooks. They have large and very tame cocks, which they do not eat because of a certain veneration that they have for them. Sometimes they make them fight with one another, and each one puts up a certain amount on his cock, and the prize goes to him whose cock is the victor. They have distilled rice wine which is stronger and better than that made from the palm.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r402" target="n402">402</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="72">Ten leguas southwest of that island, we came to an island, which, as we coasted by, seemed to us to be going upward. After entering the port, the holy <pb id="pb213" n="213"/>body [<hi>i.e.</hi>, St. Elmo&#8217;s fire] appeared to us through the pitchy darkness. There is a distance of fifty leguas<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r403" target="n403">403</ref></hi> from the beginning of that island to the port. On the following day, July nine, the king of that island sent a very beautiful prau to us, whose bow and stern were worked in gold. At the bow flew a white and blue banner surmounted with peacock feathers. Some men were playing on musical instruments [<hi lang="it-1500" xml:lang="it-1500">cinphonie</hi>] and drums. Two <hi>almadies</hi><hi rend="sup"><ref id="r404" target="n404">404</ref></hi> came with that prau. Praus resemble fustas, while the <hi>almadies</hi> are their small fishing boats. Eight old men, who were chiefs, entered the ships and took seats in the stern upon a carpet. They presented us with a painted wooden jar full of betel and areca (the fruit which they chew continually), and jessamine<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r405" target="n405">405</ref></hi> and orange blossoms, a covering of yellow silk cloth, two cages full of fowls, a couple of goats, three jarsful of distilled rice wine, and some bundles of sugarcane. They did the same to the other ship, and embracing us took their leave. The rice wine is as clear as water, but so strong that it intoxicated many of our men. It is called <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">arach</hi> [<hi>i.e.</hi>, arrack].

 </p><p n="73">Six days later the king again sent three praus with great pomp, which encircled the ships with musical instruments [<hi lang="it-1500" xml:lang="it-1500">cinphonie</hi>] playing and drums and brass gongs beating. They saluted us with their peculiar cloth caps which cover only the top of their heads. We saluted them by firing our mortars without [loading with] stones. Then they gave us a present of various kinds of food, made only of rice. Some were wrapped in leaves and were made in somewhat longish pieces, some resembled sugar-loaves, <pb id="pb215" n="215"/>while others were made in the manner of tarts with eggs and honey. They told us that their king was willing to let us get water and wood, and to trade at our pleasure. Upon hearing that seven<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r406" target="n406">406</ref></hi> of us entered their prau bearing a present to their king, which consisted of a green velvet robe made in the Turkish manner, a violet velvet chair, five brazas of red cloth, a cap,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r407" target="n407">407</ref></hi> a gilded drinking glass, a covered glass vase, three writing-books of paper, and a gilded writing-case. To the queen [we took] three brazas of [red: <hi>crossed out in original MS.</hi>] yellow cloth, a pair of silvered shoes, and a silvered needle-case full of needles. [We took] three brazas of red cloth, a cap, and a gilded drinking-glass to the governor. To the herald who came in the prau we gave a robe of red and green cloth, made in the Turkish fashion, a cap, and a writing book of paper; and to the other seven chief men, to one a bit of cloth, and to another a cap, and to all of them a writing book of paper. Then we immediately departed [for the land].

 </p><p n="74">When we reached the city, we remained about two hours in the prau, until the arrival of two elephants with silk trappings, and twelve men each of whom carried a porcelain jar covered with silk in which to carry our presents. Thereupon, we mounted the elephants while those twelve men preceded us afoot with the presents in the jars. In this way we went to the house of the governor, where we were given a supper of many kinds of food. During the night we slept on cotton mattresses,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r408" target="n408">408</ref></hi> whose lining was of taffeta, and the sheets of Cambaia. Next day we stayed in the house until noon. Then we went to the <pb id="pb217" n="217"/>king&#8217;s palace upon elephants, with our presents in front as on the preceding day. All the streets from the governor&#8217;s to the king&#8217;s house were full of men with swords, spears, and shields, for such were the king&#8217;s orders. We entered the courtyard of the palace mounted on the elephants. We went up a ladder accompanied by the governor and other chiefs, and entered a large hall full of many nobles,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r409" target="n409">409</ref></hi> where we sat down upon a carpet with the presents in the jars near us. At the end of that hall there is another hall higher but somewhat smaller. It was all adorned with silk hangings, and two windows, through which light entered the hall and hung with two brocade curtains, opened from it. There were three hundred footsoldiers with naked rapiers at their thighs in that hall to guard the king.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r410" target="n410">410</ref></hi> At the end of the small hall was a large window from which a brocade curtain was drawn aside so that we could see within it the king seated at a table with one of his young sons chewing betel.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r411" target="n411">411</ref></hi> No one but women were behind him. Then a chief told us that we could not speak to the king, and that if we wished anything, we were to tell it to him, so that he could communicate it to one of higher rank. The latter would communicate it to a brother of the governor who was stationed in the smaller hall, and this man would communicate it by means of a speaking-tube through a hole in the wall to one who was inside with the king. The chief taught us the manner of making three obeisances to the king with our hands clasped above the head, raising first one foot and then the other and then kissing the hands toward him, and we did so, that being the method of the royal obeisance. <pb id="pb219" n="219"/>We told the king that we came from the king of Spagnia, and that the latter desired to make peace with him and asked only for permission to trade. The king had us told that since the king of Spagnia desired to be his friend, he was very willing to be his, and said that we could take water and wood, and trade at our pleasure. Then we gave him the presents, on receiving each of which he nodded slightly. To each one of us was given some brocaded and gold cloth and silk, which were placed upon our left shoulders, where they were left but a moment.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r412" target="n412">412</ref></hi> They presented us with refreshments of cloves and cinnamon, after which the curtains were drawn to and the windows closed. The men in the palace were all attired in cloth of gold and silk which covered their privies, and carried daggers with gold hafts adorned with pearls and precious gems, and they had many rings on their hands. We returned upon the elephants to the governor&#8217;s house, seven men carrying the king&#8217;s presents to us and always preceding us. When we reached the house, they gave each one of us his present, placing them upon our left shoulders. We gave each of those men a couple of knives for his trouble. Nine men came to the governor&#8217;s house with a like number of large wooden trays from the king. Each tray contained ten or twelve porcelain dishes full of veal, capons, chickens, peacocks, and other animals, and fish. We supped on the ground upon a palm mat from thirty or thirty-two different kinds of meat besides the fish and other things. At each mouthful of food we drank a small cupful of their distilled wine from a porcelain cup the size of an egg. We ate rice and other sweet food <pb id="pb221" n="221"/>with gold spoons like ours. In our sleeping quarters there during those two nights, two torches of white wax were kept constantly alight in two rather tall silver candlesticks, and two large lamps full of oil with four wicks apiece and two men to snuff them continually. We went elephant-back to the seashore, where we found two praus which took us back to the ships. That city<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r413" target="n413">413</ref></hi> is entirely built in salt water, except the houses of the king and certain chiefs. It contains twenty-five thousand fires [<hi>i.e.</hi>, families].<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r414" target="n414">414</ref></hi> The houses are all constructed of wood and built up from the ground on tall pillars. When the tide is high the women go in boats through the settlement [<hi>tera</hi>] selling the articles necessary to maintain life. There is a large brick wall in front of the king&#8217;s house with towers like a fort, in which were mounted fifty-six bronze [<hi>metalo</hi>] pieces, and six of iron. During the two days of our stay there, many pieces were discharged. That king is a Moro and his name is Raia Siripada. He was forty years old and corpulent. No one serves him except women who are the daughters<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r415" target="n415">415</ref></hi> of chiefs. He never goes outside of his palace, unless when he goes hunting, and no one is allowed to talk with him except through the speaking tube. He has x scribes, called Xiritoles,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r416" target="n416">416</ref></hi> who write down his deeds on very thin tree bark.

 </p><p n="75">On Monday morning, July twenty-nine, we saw more than one hundred praus divided into three squadrons and a like number of tunguli <hi rend="sup"><ref id="r417" target="n417">417</ref></hi> (which are their small boats) coming toward us. Upon catching sight of them, imagining that there was some trickery afoot, we hoisted our sails as quickly as possible, <pb id="pb223" n="223"/>abandoning an anchor in our haste. We expected especially that we were to be captured in between certain junks which had anchored behind us on the preceding day. We immediately turned upon the latter, capturing four of them and killing many persons. Three or four of the junks sought flight by beaching. In one of the junks which we captured was the son of the king of the island of Lozon. He was the captain-general of the king of Burne, and came with those junks from a large city named Laoe,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r418" target="n418">418</ref></hi> which is located at the end of that island [<hi>i.e.</hi>, Borneo] toward Java Major. He had destroyed and sacked that city because it refused to obey the king [of Burne], but the king of Java Major instead. Giovan Carvaio, our pilot, allowed that captain and the junks to go without our consent, for a certain sum of gold, as we learned afterward. Had the pilot not given up the captain to the king, the latter would have given us whatever we had asked, for that captain was exceedingly feared throughout those regions, especially by the heathens, as the latter are very hostile to that Moro king. In that same port there is another city inhabited by heathens, which is larger than that of the Moros, and built like the latter in salt water. On that account the two peoples have daily combats together in that same harbor. The heathen king is as powerful as the Moro king, but is not so haughty, and could be converted easily to the Christian faith. When the Moro king heard how we had treated the junks, he sent us a message by one of our men who was ashore to the effect that the praus were not coming to do us any harm, but that they were going to attack the <pb id="pb225" n="225"/>heathens. As a proof of that statement, the Moros showed him some heads of men who had been killed, which they declared to be the heads of heathens. We sent a message to the king, asking him to please allow two of our men who were in the city for purposes of trade and the son of Johan Carvaio, who had been born in the country of Verzin, to come to us, but the king refused. That was the consequences of Johan Carvaio letting the above captain go. We kept sixteen of the chiefest men [of the captured junks] to take them to Spagnia, and three women in the queen&#8217;s name, but Johan Carvaio usurped the latter for himself.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r419" target="n419">419</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="76">Junks are their ships and are made in the following manner. The bottom part is built about two palmos above the water and is of planks fastened with wooden pegs, which are very well made; above that they are entirely made of very large bamboos. They have a bamboo as a counterweight. One of those junks carries as much cargo as a ship. Their masts are of bamboo, and the sails of the bark of trees.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r420" target="n420">420</ref></hi> Their porcelain is a sort of exceedingly white earth which is left for fifty years under the earth before it is worked, for otherwise it would not be fine. The father buries it for the son. If [poison] is placed in a dish made of fine porcelain, the dish immediately breaks.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r421" target="n421">421</ref></hi> The money made by the Moros in those regions is of bronze [<hi>metalo</hi>] pierced in the middle in order that it may be strung. On only one side of it are four characters, which are letters of the great king of Chiina. We call that money <hi>picis</hi>.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r422" target="n422">422</ref></hi> They gave us six porcelain dishes for one <hi>cathil</hi><hi rend="sup"><ref id="r423" target="n423">423</ref></hi> (which is equivalent to two of our libras) <pb id="pb227" n="227"/>of quicksilver; one hundred <hi>picis</hi> for one book of writing paper; one small porcelain vase for one hundred and sixty cathils of bronze [<hi>metalo</hi>]; one porcelain vase for three knives; one bahar (which is equivalent to two hundred and three cathils), of wax for 160 cathils of bronze [<hi>metalo</hi>]; one bahar of salt for eighty cathils of bronze [<hi>metalo</hi>]; one bahar of <hi>anime</hi> to calk the ships (for no pitch is found in those regions) for forty cathils of bronze [<hi>metalo</hi>].<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r424" target="n424">424</ref></hi> Twenty tahils make one cathil. At that place the people highly esteem bronze [<hi>metalo</hi>], quicksilver, glass, cinnabar,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r425" target="n425">425</ref></hi> wool cloth, linens, and all our other merchandise, although iron and spectacles<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r426" target="n426">426</ref></hi> more than all the rest. Those Moros go naked as do the other peoples [of those regions]. They drink quicksilver&#8212;the sick man drinks it to cleanse himself, and the well man to preserve his health.

 </p><p n="77">The king of Burne has two pearls as large as two hen&#8217;s eggs. They are so round that they will not stand still on a table. I know that for a fact, for when we carried the king&#8217;s presents to him, signs were made for him to show them to us, but he said that he would show them next day. Afterward some chiefs said that they had seen them.

 </p><p n="78">Those Moros worship Mahomet. The latter&#8217;s law orders them not to eat pork; as they wash the buttocks with the left hand, not to use that hand in eating;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r427" target="n427">427</ref></hi> not to cut anything with the right hand; to sit down to urinate; not to kill fowls or goats without first addressing the sun; to cut off the tops of the wings with the little bits of skin that stick up from under and the feet of fowls; then to split them in twain; to wash the face with the right hand, but <pb id="pb231" n="231"/>not to cleanse the teeth with the fingers; and not to eat anything that has been killed unless it be by themselves.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r428" target="n428">428</ref></hi> They are circumcised like the Jews.

 </p><p n="79">Camphor, a kind of balsam, is produced in that island. It exudes between the wood and the bark, and the drops are as small as [grains of] wheat bran.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r429" target="n429">429</ref></hi> If it is exposed it gradually evaporates [<hi>literally</hi>: becomes nothing]. Those people call it <hi>capor</hi>. Cinnamon, ginger, mirabolans, oranges, lemons, nangcas, watermelons, cucumbers, gourds, turnips, cabbages, scallions, cows, buffaloes, swine, goats, chickens, geese, deer, elephants, horses, and other things are found there.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r430" target="n430">430</ref></hi> That island is so large that it takes three months to sail round it in a prau. It lies in a latitude of five and one-fourth degrees toward the Arctic Pole, and in a longitude of one hundred and seventy-six and two-thirds degrees from the line of demarcation, and its name is Burne.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r431" target="n431">431</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="80">Leaving that island, we turned back in order to find a suitable place to calk the ships, for they were leaking. One ship ran on to some shoals of an island called Bibalon,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r432" target="n432">432</ref></hi> because of the carelessness of its pilot, but by the help of God we freed it. A sailor of that ship incautiously snuffed a candle into a barrel full of gunpowder, but he quickly snatched it out without any harm.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r433" target="n433">433</ref></hi> Then pursuing our course, we captured a prau laden with cocoanuts on its way to Burne. Its crew sought refuge on an islet, until we captured it.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r434" target="n434">434</ref></hi> Three other praus escaped behind certain islets.

 </p><p n="81">At the head of Burne between it and an island called Cimbonbon, which lies in [a latitude of] eight <pb id="pb233" n="233"/>degrees and seven minutes,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r435" target="n435">435</ref></hi> is a perfect port for repairing ships. Consequently, we entered it; but as we lacked many things for repairing the ships, we delayed there for forty-two days. During that time, each one of us labored hard, one at one thing and one at another. Our greatest fatigue however was to go barefoot to the woods for wood. In that island there are wild boars, of which we killed one which was going by water from one island to another [by pursuing it] with the small boat. Its head was two and one-half palmos long,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r436" target="n436">436</ref></hi> and its teeth were large. There are found large crocodiles, both on land and sea, oysters and shellfish of various kinds. Among the last named we found two, the flesh of one of which weighed twenty-six libras, and the other forty-four.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r437" target="n437">437</ref></hi> We caught a fish, which had a head like that of a hog and two horns. Its body consisted entirely of one bone, and on its back it resembled a saddle; and it was small.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r438" target="n438">438</ref></hi> Trees are also found there which produce leaves which are alive when they fall, and walk. Those leaves are quite like those of the mulberry, but are not so long. On both sides near the stem, which is short and pointed, they have two feet. They have no blood, but if one touches<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r439" target="n439">439</ref></hi> them they run away. I kept one of them for nine days in a box. When I opened the box, that leaf went round and round it.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r440" target="n440">440</ref></hi> I believe those leaves live on nothing but air.

 </p><p n="82">Having left that island,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r441" target="n441">441</ref></hi> that is, the port, we met at the head of the island of Pulaoan a junk which was coming from Burne, on which was the governor of Pulaoan. We made them a signal to haul in their sails, and as they refused to haul them in, we captured <pb id="pb235" n="235"/>the junk by force, and sacked it. [We told] the governor [that] if [he] wished his freedom, he was to give us, inside of seven days, four hundred measures of rice, twenty swine, twenty goats, and one hundred and fifty fowls. After that he presented us with cocoanuts, figs [<hi>i.e.</hi>, bananas], sugarcanes, jars full of palm wine, and other things. Seeing his liberality, we returned some of his daggers and arquebuses to him, giving him in addition, a flag, a yellow damask robe, and xv brazas of cloth; to his son, a cloak of blue cloth; to a brother of the governor, a robe of green cloth and other things; and we parted from them as friends. We turned our course back between the island of Cagaian and the port of Cippit, and laid our course east by south in order that we might find the islands of Malucho. We passed by certain reefs [<hi>literally</hi>: small elevations] near which we found the sea to be full of grass, although the depth was very great. When we passed through them, it seemed as though we were entering another sea. Leaving Chipit to the east, we found two island, Zolo and Taghima,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r442" target="n442">442</ref></hi> which lie toward the west, and near which pearls are found.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r443" target="n443">443</ref></hi> The two pearls of the king of Burne were found there, and the king got them, as was told us, in the following manner. That king took to wife a daughter of the king of Zolo, who told him that her father had those two pearls. The king determined to get possession of them by hook or by crook. Going one night with five hundred praus,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r444" target="n444">444</ref></hi> he captured the king and two of his sons, and took them to Burne with him. [He told] the king of Zolo that if he wished freedom, he must surrender the two pearls to him.

 <pb id="pb239" n="239"/></p><p n="83">Then we laid our course east by north between two settlements called Cauit and Subanin, and an inhabited island called Monoripa, located x leguas from the reefs.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r445" target="n445">445</ref></hi> The people of that island make their dwellings in boats and do not live otherwise. In those two settlements of Cavit and Subanin, which are located in the island of Butuan and Calaghan, is found the best cinnamon that grows. Had we stayed there two days, those people would have laden our ships for us, but as we had a wind favorable for passing a point and certain islets which were near that island, we did not wish to delay. While under sail we bartered two large knives which we had taken from the governor of Pulaoan for seventeen libras [of cinnamon]. The cinnamon tree grows to a height of three or four cubits, and as thick as the fingers of the hand. It has but three or four small branches and its leaves resemble those of the laurel. Its bark is the cinnamon, and it is gathered twice per year. The wood and leaves are as strong as the cinnamon when they are green. Those people call it <hi>caiu mana</hi>. <hi>Caiu</hi> means wood, and <hi>mana</hi>, sweet, hence, &#8220;sweet wood.&#8221;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r446" target="n446">446</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="84">Laying our course toward the northeast, and going to a large city called Maingdanao, which is located in the island of Butuan and Calaghan, so that we might gather information concerning Maluco, we captured by force a <hi>bigniday</hi>,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r447" target="n447">447</ref></hi> a vessel resembling a prau, and killed seven men. It contained only eighteen men, and they were as well built as any whom we had seen in those regions.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r448" target="n448">448</ref></hi> All were chiefs of Maingdanao, among them being one who told us that he was a brother of the king of Maingdanao, <pb id="pb243" n="243"/>and that he knew the location of Malucho. Through his directions we discontinued our course toward the northeast, and took that toward the southeast. At a cape of that island of Butuan and Caleghan, and near a river, are found shaggy men who are exceedingly great fighters and archers. They use swords one palmo in length, and eat only raw human hearts with the juice of oranges or lemons.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r449" target="n449">449</ref></hi> Those shaggy people are called Benaian. When we took our course toward the southeast, we lay in a latitude of six degrees and seven minutes toward the Arctic Pole, and thirty<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r450" target="n450">450</ref></hi> leguas from Cavit.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r451" target="n451">451</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="85">Sailing toward the southeast, we found four islands, [namely], Ciboco, Biraham Batolach,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r452" target="n452">452</ref></hi> Sarangani, and Candighar.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r453" target="n453">453</ref></hi> One Saturday night, October twenty-six, while coasting by Birahan Batolach, we encountered a most furious storm. Thereupon, praying God, we lowered all the sails. Immediately our three saints appeared to us and dissipated all the darkness.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r454" target="n454">454</ref></hi> St. Elmo remained for more than two hours on the maintop, like a torch; St. Nicholas on the mizzentop; and St. Clara on the foretop. We promised a slave to St. Elmo, St. Nicholas, and St. Clara, and gave alms to each one. Then continuing our voyage, we entered a harbor between the two islands of Saranghani and Candighar, and anchored to the eastward near a settlement of Sarangani, where gold and pearls are found. Those people are heathens and go naked as do the others. That harbor lies in a latitude of five degrees nine minutes, and is fifty leguas from Cavit.

 </p><p n="86">Remaining one day in that harbor, we captured two pilots by force, in order that they might show <pb id="pb247" n="247"/>us where Malucho lay.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r455" target="n455">455</ref></hi> Then laying our course south southwest, we passed among eight inhabited and desert islands, which were situated in the manner of a street. Their names are Cheaua, Cauiao, Cabiao, Camanuca, Cabaluzao, Cheai, Lipan, and Nuza.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r456" target="n456">456</ref></hi> Finally we came to an island at their end, which was very beautiful to look at. As we had a contrary wind, so that we could not double a point of that island, we sailed hither and thither near it. Consequently, one of the men whom we had captured at Saranghai, and the brother of the king of Maingdanao who took with him his small son, escaped during the night by swimming to that island. But the boy was drowned, for he was unable to hold tightly to his father&#8217;s shoulder. Being unable to double the said point, we passed below the island where there were many islets. That island has four kings, [namely], Raia Matandatu, Raia Lalagha, Ra&#237;a Bapti, and Raia Parabu. The people are heathens. The island lies in a latitude of three and one-half degrees toward the Arctic Pole and is 27 leguas from Saranghany. Its name is Sanghir.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r457" target="n457">457</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="87">Continuing the same course, we passed near six islands, [namely], Cheama, Carachita, Para, Zanghalura, Ciau (which is ten leguas from Sanghir, and has a high but not large mountain, and whose king is called Raia Ponto), and Paghinzara.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r458" target="n458">458</ref></hi> The latter is located eight leguas from Ciau, and has three high mountains. The name of its king is Raia Babintan.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r459" target="n459">459</ref></hi> [Then we found the island] Talaut; and we found twelve leguas to the east of Paghinzara two islands, not very large, but inhabited, called Zoar and Meau.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r460" target="n460">460</ref></hi> After passing those two islands, on <pb id="pb251" n="251"/>Wednesday, the sixth of November, we discovered four lofty islands fourteen leguas east of the two [abovementioned islands]. The pilot who still remained with us told us that those four islands were Maluco. Therefore, we thanked God and as an expression of our joy discharged all our artillery. It was no wonder that we were so glad, for we had passed twenty-seven months less two days in our search for Malucho.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r461" target="n461">461</ref></hi> Among all those islands [among all those islands: <hi>doublet in original MS.</hi>], even to Malucho, the shallowest bottom that we found was at a depth of one or two hundred brazas, notwithstanding the assertion of the Portuguese that that region could not be navigated because of the numerous shoals and the dark sky as they have imagined.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r462" target="n462">462</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="88">Three hours before sunset on Friday, November eight, 1521,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r463" target="n463">463</ref></hi> we entered into a harbor of an island called Tadore, and anchoring near the shore in twenty brazas we fired all our artillery. Next day the king came to the ships in a prau, and circled about them once. We immediately went to meet him with the small boat, in order to show him honor. He made us enter his prau and seat ourselves near him. He was seated under a silk awning which sheltered him on all sides. In front of him was one of his sons with the royal scepter, and two persons with two gold jars to pour water on his hands, and two others with two gilded caskets filled with their betel. The king told us that we were welcome there, and that he had dreamt some time ago that some ships were coming to Malucho from remote parts; and that for more assurance he had determined to <pb id="pb253" n="253"/>consult the moon,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r464" target="n464">464</ref></hi> whereupon he had seen the ships were coming, and that we were they. Upon the king entering our ships all kissed his hand and then we led him to the stern. When he entered inside there, he would not stoop, but entered from above.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r465" target="n465">465</ref></hi> Causing him to sit down in a red velvet chair, we clothed him in a yellow velvet robe made in the Turkish fashion. In order to show him greater honor, we sat down on the ground near him. Then when all were seated, the king began to speak and said that he and all his people desired ever to be the most loyal friends and vassals to our king of Spagnia. He received us as his children, and we could go ashore as if in our own houses, for from that time thenceforth, his island was to be called no more Tadore but Castiglia, because of the great love which he bore to our king, his sovereign. We made him a present which consisted of the robe, the chair, a piece of delicate linen, four brazas of scarlet cloth, a piece of brocaded silk, a piece of yellow damask, some Indian cloth embroidered with gold and silk, a piece of <hi>berania</hi> (the white linen of Cambaia), two caps, six strings of glass beads, twelve knives, three large mirrors, six pairs of scissors, six combs, some gilded drinking-cups,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r466" target="n466">466</ref></hi> and other articles. To his son we gave an Indian cloth of gold and silk, a large mirror, a cap, and two knives;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r467" target="n467">467</ref></hi> and to each of nine others&#8212;all of them his chiefs&#8212;a silk cloth, caps, and two knives; and to many others caps or knives. We kept giving presents until the king bade us desist. After that he declared to us that he had nothing else except his own life to send to the king his sovereign. We were to approach nearer to the city, and whoever <pb id="pb255" n="255"/>came to the ships at night, we were to kill with our muskets. In leaving the stern, the king would never bend his head.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r468" target="n468">468</ref></hi> When he took his leave we discharged all the guns. That king is a Moro and about forty-five years old. He is well built and has a royal presence,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r469" target="n469">469</ref></hi> and is an excellent astrologer. At that time he was clad in a shirt of the most delicate white stuff with the ends of the sleeves embroidered in gold, and in a cloth that reached from his waist to the ground. He was barefoot, and had a silk scarf wrapped about his head [his head, <hi>doublet in original MS.</hi>], and above it a garland of flowers. His name is Raia Sultan Manzor.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r470" target="n470">470</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="89">On Sunday, November x, that king desired us to tell him how long it was since we had left Spagnia, and what pay and quintalada<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r471" target="n471">471</ref></hi> the king gave to each of us. He requested us to give him a signature of the king and a royal banner, for then and thenceforth, he would cause it that his island and another called Tarenate (provided that he were able to crown one of his [sons: <hi>crossed out in original MS.</hi>] grandsons,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r472" target="n472">472</ref></hi> named Calonaghapi) would both belong to the king of Spagnia; and for the honor of his king he was ready to fight to the death, and when he could no longer resist, he would go to Spagnia with all his family in a junk<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r473" target="n473">473</ref></hi> which he was having built new, carrying the royal signature and banner; and therefore he was the king&#8217;s servant for a long time. He begged us to leave him some men so that he might constantly be reminded of the king of Spagnia. He did not ask for merchandise because the latter would not remain with him.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r474" target="n474">474</ref></hi> He told us that he would go to an island called Bachian, in order sooner to <pb id="pb257" n="257"/>furnish the ships with cloves, for there were not enough dry cloves in his island to load the two ships. As that day was Sunday, it was decided not to trade The festive day of those people is our Friday.

 </p><p n="90">In order that your most illustrious Lordship may know the islands where cloves grow, they are five, [namely], Tarenatte, Tadore, Mutir, Machian, and Bachian. Tarenate is the chief one, and when its king was alive, he ruled nearly all the others. Tadore, the one where we were, has a king. Mutir and Machian have no king but are ruled by the people, and when the two kings of Tarenate and of Tadore engage in war, those two islands furnish them with men. The last island is Bachian, and it has a king. That entire province where cloves grow is called Malucho.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r475" target="n475">475</ref></hi> At that time it was not eight months since one Francesco Seranno<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r476" target="n476">476</ref></hi> had died in Tarenate. [He was] a Portuguese and the captain-general of the king of Tarenate and opposed the king of Tadore. He did so well that he constrained the king of Tadore to give one of his daughters to wife to the king of Tarenate, and almost all the sons of the chiefs as hostages. The above mentioned grandson of the king of Tadore was born to that daughter. Peace having been made between the two kings, and when Francesco Seranno came one day to Tadore to trade cloves, the king of Tadore had him poisoned with the said betel leaves. He lived only four days. His king wished to have him buried according to his law [<hi>i.e.</hi>, with Mahometan rites], but three Christians who were his servants would not consent to it. He left a son and a daughter, both young, born by a woman whom he had taken to wife in Java Major, <pb id="pb259" n="259"/>and two hundred bahars of cloves. He was a close friend and a relative of our royal captain-general, and was the cause of inciting the latter to undertake that enterprise, for when our captain was at Malacha, he had written to him several times that he was in Tarenate. As Don Manuel, then king of Portugal, refused to increase our captain-general&#8217;s pension by only a single testoon per month for his merits, the latter went to Spagnia, where he had obtained everything for which he could ask from his sacred Majesty.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r477" target="n477">477</ref></hi> Ten days after the death of Francesco Seranno, the king of Tarenate, by name, Raya Abuleis, having expelled his son-in-law, the king of Bachian, was poisoned by his daughter, the wife of the latter king, under pretext of trying to bring about peace between the two kings. The king lingered but two days, and left nine principal sons, whose names are Chechili Momuli, Jadore Vunighi, Chechili de Roix, Cili Manzur, Cili Pagi, Chialin, Chechilin Cathara, Vaiechu Serich, and Calano Ghapi.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r478" target="n478">478</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="91">On Monday, November xi, one of the sons of the king of Tarenate, [to wit], Chechili de Roix, came to the ships clad in red velvet. He had two praus and his men were playing upon the abovementioned gongs. He refused to enter the ship at that time. He had [charge of] the wife and children, and the other possessions of Francesco Seranno. When we found out who he was, we sent a message to the king, asking him whether we should receive Chechili de Roix, since we were in his port, and he replied to us that we could do as we pleased. But the son of the king, seeing that we were hesitating, moved off somewhat from the ships. We went to him with the <pb id="pb261" n="261"/>boat in order to present him an Indian cloth of gold and silk, and some knives, mirrors, and scissors. He accepted them somewhat haughtily, and immediately departed. He had a Christian Indian with him named Manuel, the servant of one Petro Alfonso de Lorosa,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r479" target="n479">479</ref></hi> a Portuguese who went from Bandan to Tarenate, after the death of Francesco Seranno. As the servant knew how to talk Portuguese, he came aboard our ship, and told us that, although the sons of the king of Tarenate were at enmity with the king of Tadore, yet they were always at the service of the king of Spagnia. We<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r480" target="n480">480</ref></hi> sent a letter to Pietro Alfonso de Lorosa, through his servant, [telling him] that he could come without any hesitation.

 </p><p n="92">Those kings have as many women as they wish, but only one chief wife, whom all the others obey. The abovesaid king of Tadore had a large house outside of the city, where two hundred of his chief women lived with a like number of women to serve them. When the king eats, he sits alone or with his chief wife in a high place like a gallery whence he can see all the other women who sit about the gallery; and he orders her who best pleases him to sleep with him that night. After the king has finished eating, if he orders those women to eat together, they do so, but if not, each one goes to eat in her own chamber. No one is allowed to see those women without permission from the king, and if anyone is found near the king&#8217;s house by day or by night, he is put to death. Every family is obliged to give the king one or two of its daughters. That king had twenty-six children, eight sons, and the rest daughters. Lying next that island there is a very large <pb id="pb263" n="263"/>island, called Giailolo [<hi>i.e.</hi>, Gilolo], which is inhabited by Moros and heathens. Two kings are found there among the Moros, one of them, as we were told by the king, having had six hundred children, and the other five hundred and twenty-five.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r481" target="n481">481</ref></hi> The heathens do not have so many women; nor do they live under so many superstitions, but adore for all that day the first thing that they see in the morning when they go out of their houses. The king of those heathens, called Raya Papua, is exceedingly rich in gold, and lives in the interior of the island. Reeds as thick around as the leg and filled with water that is very good to drink, grow on the flinty rocks in the island of Giaiallo.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r482" target="n482">482</ref></hi> We bought many of them from those people.

 </p><p n="93">On Tuesday, November twelve, the king had a house built for us in the city in one day for our merchandise. We carried almost all of our goods thither, and left three of our men to guard them. We immediately began to trade in the following manner. For x brazas of red cloth of very good quality, they gave us one bahar of cloves, which is equivalent to four quintals and six libras; for fifteen brazas of cloth of not very good quality, one quintal and one hundred libras; for fifteen hatchets, one bahar; for thirty-five glass drinking-cups, one bahar (the king getting them all); for seventeen cathils of cinnabar, one bahar; for seventeen cathils of quicksilver, one bahar; for twenty-six brazas of linen, one bahar; for twenty-five brazas of finer linen, one bahar; for one hundred and fifty knives, one bahar; for fifty pairs of scissors, one bahar; for forty caps, one bahar; for x pieces of Guzerat cloth,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r483" target="n483">483</ref></hi> one bahar; for three <pb id="pb265" n="265"/>of those gongs of theirs, two bahars;<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r484" target="n484">484</ref></hi> for one quinta of bronze [<hi>metalo</hi>], one bahar. [Almost] all the mirrors were broken, and the few good ones the king wished for himself. Many of those things [that we traded] were from the abovementioned junks which we had captured. Our haste to return to Spagnia made us dispose of our merchandise at better bargains [to the natives] than we should have done.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r485" target="n485">485</ref></hi> Daily so many boatloads of goats, fowls, figs [<hi>i.e.</hi>, bananas], cocoanuts, and other kinds of food were brought to the ships, that we were surprised. We supplied the ships with good water, which issues forth hot [from the ground], but if it stands for the space of an hour outside its spring, it becomes very cold, the reason therefor being that it comes from the mountain of cloves. This is quite the opposite from the assertion in Spagnia that water must be carried to Maluco from distant parts.<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r486" target="n486">486</ref></hi>

 </p><p n="94">On Wednesday, the king sent his son, named Mossahap, to Mutir, so that they might supply us more quickly. On that day we told the king that we had captured certain Indians. The king thanked God heartily, and asked us to do him the kindness to give him their persons, so that he might send them back to their land, with five of his own men, in order that they might make the king of Spagnia and his fame known. Then we gave him the three women who had been captured in the queen&#8217;s name for the reason already advanced. Next day, we gave the king all the prisoners, except those from Burne, for which he thanked us fervently. Thereupon, he asked us, in order thereby to show our love for him, to kill all the swine that we had in <pb id="pb267" n="267"/>the ships, in return for which he would give us an equal number of goats and fowls. We killed them in order to show him a pleasure,<hi rend="sup"><ref id="r487" target="n487">487</ref></hi> and hung them up under the deck. When those people happen to see any swine they cover their faces in order that they might not look upon them or catch their odor.

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n1" target="r1">1</ref></hi> The greater part of the life of Antonio Pigafetta is shrouded in darkness. The Pigafetta family, who resided at Venice, and was formerly of Tuscan origin, dates back before him for several centuries. The Pigafetta escutcheon was white above and black below with a white transverse bar running from left to right. On the lower part were three red roses, one of them on the bar. The old family house is still standing and shows the motto <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il nest rose sans espine</hi>, <hi>i.e.</hi>, &#8220;No rose without a thorn,&#8221; which was probably carved in 1481, when the house was repaired, and not by Antonio Pigafetta after his return from his voyage as some assert. Antonio Pigafetta was born toward the close of the fifteenth century, but the date cannot be positively fixed, some declaring it to be 1491; but Harrisse who follows Marzari, gives the date as 1480. It is unknown who his parents were and some have asserted that he was a natural child, although this is evidently unfounded, as he was received into the military order of St. John. At an early age he probably became familiar with the sea and developed his taste for traveling. He went to Spain with the Roman ambassador Chieregato, in 1519, but in what capacity is unknown. Hearing details of Magalh&#227;es&#8217;s intended voyage he contrived to accompany him. Navarrete surmises that he is the Antonio Lombardo mentioned in the list of the captain&#8217;s servants and volunteers who sailed on the expedition, so called <pb id="pb274" n="274"/>as his country was Lombardy. After the return of the &#8220;Victoria,&#8221; he journeyed in Spain, Portugal, and France, and returned to Italy probably in January, 1523. The relation presented by him to C&#225;rlos I was probably a draft of his notes taken daily throughout the voyage. His <hi>Relation</hi> as we know it was undertaken at the request of the marchioness of Mantova, but its composition was arrested by an order from Clement VII to come to Rome, whither he went in December, 1523, or January, 1524, meeting Villiers l&#8217;Isle-Adam on his journey thither. He remained in the pope&#8217;s service but a short time, for in April, 1524, he was back in Venice. That same year he was granted a copyright on his <hi>Relation</hi>, which he intended to print, for twenty years. Pozzo says that he was received into the Order of St. John, October 3, 1524, but it was probably somewhat before that date. Between the dates of August, 1524, and August, 1530, his work was presented to Villiers l&#8217;Isle-Adam. Nothing further is known of him, though some say that he fought against the Turks as late as 1536, while others have placed his death in 1534 or 1535 and at Malta. In addition to his <hi>Relation</hi> Pigafetta wrote a <hi>Treatise on the art of navigation</hi>, which follows his <hi>Relation</hi>. This is not presented in the present publication, notwithstanding its importance, as being outside of the present scope. It is reproduced by Mosto. He has sometimes been confused with Marcantonio Pigafetta (a Venetian gentleman), the author of <hi>Itinerario da Vienna a Constantinopoli</hi> (London, 1585); and wrongly called Vincenzo Antonio Pigafetta, the &#8220;Vincenzo&#8221; being an error for &#8220;vicentino,&#8221; <hi>i.e.</hi>, &#8220;Venetian.&#8221; See Mosto, <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il primo viaggio ... di Antonio Pigafetta</hi> (Roma, 1894), pp. 13&#8211;30; Larousse&#8217;s <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire</hi>; and <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La grande Encyclop&#233;die</hi> (Paris).

He was elected grand master of his order in 1521 and in the following year occurred his heroic defense of Rhodes with but four thousand five hundred soldiers against the huge fleet and army of Soliman. After six months he was compelled to surrender his stronghold in October, and refusing Soliman&#8217;s entreaties to remain with him, went to Italy. In 1524 he was given the city of Viterbe by Clement VII, where in June of 1527 he held a general chapter of his order, at which it was decided to accept the island of Malta which had been offered by Charles V. The gift was confirmed by the letters-patent of Charles V in 1530, and Villiers l&#8217;Isle-Adam <pb id="pb275" n="275"/>Adam went thither in October of that year. He was always held in high esteem for his bravery, prudence, and piety. See Moreri&#8217;s <hi>Dictionaire</hi>, and Larousse&#8217;s <hi>Dictionnaire</hi>.

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n4" target="r4">4</ref></hi> The four MSS. of Pigafetta&#8217;s <hi>Relation</hi> are those known as the Ambrosian or Italian, so called from its place of deposit, the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan; no. 5,650, conserved in the Biblioth&#232;que Nationale, Paris, in French; no. 24,224, in the same library, also in French; and the Nancy MS. (also French) so called because it was conserved in Nancy, France, now owned by the heirs of Sir Thomas Phillips, Cheltenham, England. The MSS. of the Biblioth&#232;que Nationale are both shorter than the Italian MS. The Nancy MS. is said to be the most complete of the French manuscripts.

The most radical of the differences will be shown in these notes.

Later he conducted several diplomatic missions with great skill. He left Rome for Spain in December, 1518, on a private mission for the pope, and especially to effect a crusade against the Turks who were then invading Egypt and threatening Christianity. His house at Barcelona became the meeting-place of the savants of that day who discussed literature and science. See Mosto, p. 19, note 3.

In consideration of the furious and violent storms that reign on the Ocean Sea where he was about to sail, and in consideration of another reason also, namely, that the masters and captains of the other ships in his fleet had no liking for him (the reason for which I know not, unless because he, the captain-general, was a Portuguese, and they Spaniards or Castilians, who have for a long while been biased and ill-disposed toward one another, but who, in spite of that, rendered him obedience), he made his rules such as follow, so that his ships might not go astray or become separated from one another during storms at sea. He published those rules and gave them in writing to every master in the ships and ordered them to be inviolably observed and kept, unless for urgent and legitimate excuse, and the proof that any other action was impossible.&#8221;

Nochiero (French <hi>nocher</hi>) was the officer next to contramaestre, although the name, according to Littr&#233; was applied to the master or seacaptain of certain small craft. The <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">maestro</hi> (French <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma&#238;tre</hi>) was a sub-officer in charge of all the crew. The pilot was next to the captain in importance.

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n24" target="r24">24</ref></hi> The instructions pertaining to the different watches are as follows in MS. 5,650: &#8220;In addition to the said rules for carrying on the art of navigation as is fitting, and in order to avoid the dangers that may come upon those who do not have watches set, the said captain, who was skilled in the things required and in navigation, ordered three watches to be set. The first was at the beginning of the night; the second at midnight; and the third toward daybreak, which is commonly called the &#8216;diane&#8217; [<hi>i.e.</hi>, &#8216;morn&#8217;] or otherwise &#8216;the star of dawn.&#8217; The abovenamed watches were changed nightly: that is to say, that he who had stood first watch stood second the day following, while he <pb id="pb278" n="278"/>who had stood second, stood third; and thus did they continue to change nightly. The said captain ordered that his rules, both those of signals and of watches, be thoroughly observed, so that their voyage might be made with the greatest of safety. The men of the said fleet were divided into three divisions: the first was that of the captain; the second that of the pilot or boatswain&#8217;s mate; and the third that of the master. The above rules having been instituted, the captain-general determined to depart, as follows.&#8221;

The stores carried consisted of wine, olive oil, vinegar, fish, pork, peas and beans, flour, garlic, cheese, honey, almonds, anchovies, raisins, prunes, figs, sugar, quince preserves, capers, mustard, beef, and rice. The apothecary supplies were carried in the &#8220;Trinidad,&#8221; and the ecclesiastical ornaments in that ship and the &#8220;San Antonio.&#8221;

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n26" target="r26">26</ref></hi> The exact number of men who accompanied Magalh&#227;es is a matter of doubt. A royal decree, dated Barcelona, May 5, 1519, conserved in the papers of the India House of Trade in Archivo general de Indias at Sevilla, with pressmark est. 41, caj. 6, leg. 2&#8211;25, orders that only two hundred and thirty-five persons sail in the fleet. The same archives contain various registers of the fleet (sec Llorens Ascensio&#8217;s <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Primera vuelta al mundo</hi>, Madrid, 1903), one of which is published by Medina in his <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Colecci&#243;n</hi> (i, p. 113). Guillemard (<hi>Magellan</hi>, p. 326) says that at least two hundred and sixty-eight men went as is shown by the official lists and &#8220;the casual occurrence of names in the numerous and lengthy <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">autos fiscales</hi> connected with the expedition.&#8221; Guillemard conjectures that the total number must have been between two hundred and seventy and two hundred and eighty. Mosto (p. 53, note 2) says: &#8220;Castanheda and Barros say that the crews amounted to 250 men, while Herrera says 234. Navarrete&#8217;s lists show a total of 265 men. At least 37 were Portuguese, and in addition to them and the Spaniards, the crews contained Genoese and Italians (thirty or more), French (nineteen), Flemings, Germans, Sicilians, English, Corfiotes, Malays, Negroes, Moors, Madeirans, and natives of the Azores and Canary Islands. But seventeen are recorded from Seville, while there are many Biscayans. (See Guillemard, <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut supra</hi>, pp. 326&#8211;329.) The registers of men as given by Navarrete (<hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Col. de viages</hi>, iv, pp. 12&#8211;26) are as follows.

 <pb id="pb289" n="289"/></p><p>The total number of men for the ships as above given is 235. Navarrete made his list from the list conserved in Archivo general de Indias, and notes of Juan Bautista Mu&#241;oz, and various other sources. The obstacles in the way of a correct register were the abbreviation of names and places, the custom prevalent of naming people from their native town or province, and the fact that the various registers were made between 1519 and 1525. From some of these registers, it appears that the following men were also in the fleet.

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n27" target="r27">27</ref></hi> The Moorish name of Guadalquivir (from Arabic <hi>W&#226;d-al-Kebir</hi>, &#8220;the great river&#8221;), superseded the Roman name of B&#230;tis. The Romans formed all Southern Spain into one province called B&#230;tica after the name of the B&#230;tis. By the town Gioan dal Farax is meant San Juan de Aznalfarache (from Moorish <hi>Hisn al-Faradj</hi>). Its Gothic name was Osset and its Roman name Julia Constantia. It is a favorite resort of the inhabitants of Sevilla. Cor&#237;a was once a Roman potters&#8217; town and is still celebrated for its jars. San L&#250;car de Barrameda was named in honor of St. Luke. It was captured from the Moors in 1264 and granted to the father of Guzman el Bueno. It attained importance after the discovery of America because of its good harbor. The house of Medina-Sidonia was founded by Alfonso P&#233;rez de Guzman, a famous captain.

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n28" target="r28">28</ref></hi> The original of this passage is obscure. The distance given (ten leagues; and both MS. 5,650 and Eden agree substantially with it) is far too short for the distance between San Lucar and Cape St. Vincent, which is over one hundred miles. Pigafetta may have forgotten the actual distance, or it may have been an error of his amanuensis. It is possible to translate as follows: &#8220;which lies in 37 degrees of latitude, [that parallel being] x leguas from the said port;&#8221; for &#8220;longui&#8221; may be taken as agreeing with &#8220;gradi.&#8221; In all rendering of distances, the Spanish form will be used in preference to the Italian; and the same will apply to the names of Spanish coins.

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n29" target="r29">29</ref></hi> MS. 5,650 reads: &#8220;And after passing many small villages along the said river, we at last reached a chateau belonging to the duke of Medinacidonia, and called Sainct Lucar, where there is a port with an entrance into the Ocean Sea. One enters that port by the east wind, and leaves by the west. Nearby is the cape of Sainct Vincent, which, according to cosmography, lies in a latitude of thirty-seven degrees at a distance of twenty miles from <pb id="pb291" n="291"/>the said port. From the said city [of Sevilla] to the said port by the river abovesaid, the distance is thirty-five or forty miles.&#8221; This passage might be cited as a proof that Pigafetta did not translate or write the French version, but that the work was done by another, who takes various liberties with his original.

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n30" target="r30">30</ref></hi> MS. 5,650 reads: &#8220;furnish the fleet.&#8221;

This is another instance in which the French adapter adds an explanation to the Italian, thus explaining the Italian term <hi>garbino</hi>, &#8220;southwest.&#8221;

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n33" target="r33">33</ref></hi> MS. 5,650 reads wrongly: &#8220;sixteenth.&#8221; The so-called Genoese pilot (the author of the &#8220;Roteiro,&#8221; by which name his account will be hereafter designated, and concerning whom, see Guillemard&#8217;s <hi>Magellan</hi>, p. 145, and Mosto, p. 32, and note 4) gives the date of departure as September 21 (with which Barros agrees) and the arrival at Tenerife as the twenty-ninth (see Stanley, p. 1). Peter Martyr, Gomara, and Oviedo agree with Pigafetta, while Castanheda makes the departure in January, 1520. Hughes observes that if one keep in mind the circumstance that the day of the arrival coincided with the day dedicated by the Church to St. Michael, the date September 29 seems more admissible. However, one may reconcile the two dates of the arrival by observing that the ships stopped at Tenerife until October 2; while Herrera says that the ships fetched Monta&#241;a Roja (the Monte rosso of the text) on September 29. See Mosto, p. 53, notes 4 and 5. It should be noted that Gomara and Oviedo are not entirely trustworthy authorities, and that many times they have simply copied from authorities, such as Maximilianus Transylvanus, who is not always to be relied upon.

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n34" target="r34">34</ref></hi> The Canaries were known to the ancients under the names of Islands of the Blest, Fortunate Islands, and the Hesperides. The Moors knew of them under the name of Islands of Khaledat, but had no practical acquaintance with them. In the fourteenth century these islands began to be known to Europeans, especially through the Portuguese. In 1402, the Frenchman Jean de Bethencourt went there, and shortly after began their conquest under the auspices of the crown of Castile. In consequence of the settlements made by Bethencourt, the islands were definitely ceded to Spain in 1481 (see Birch&#8217;s <hi>Alboquerque</hi>, London, 1875&#8211;1884, Hakluyt Society Publications, ii, p. vi). The inhabitants of the islands were known as Guanches or Guanchinet, the latter meaning &#8220;men of Tenerife.&#8221; The inhabitants of this island, holding out longer than the others, were not subdued until 1496. See also <hi>Conquest of Canaries</hi> (London, 1877); and <hi>History and Description <pb id="pb292" n="292"/>of Africa</hi> (London, 1896), i, pp. 99&#8211;101: both publications of the Hakluyt Society. The island of Tenerife was formerly called Nivana and by some the Island of Hell. Like all the other islands of the Canaries it is volcanic in formation, and its peak, the Teyde, is one of the largest volcanic cones known. Its latitude is 28&#176; 15&#8242;.

Gregorio Chil y Naranio (<hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Estudios hist&#243;ricos ... de las islas Canarias</hi>, 1879) believes Pigafetta means here the island of Palma, and that the first navigators visited only the coast and so did not see the lake in the interior (Mosto, p. 53, note 9).

When he appeared, he remained a quarter of an hour; and at his departure a great flash of light occurred which blinded all the men. Eden (p. 250) calls it the fire of St. Helen. Continuing, Eden injects into his abridgment of the first circumnavigation a description of St. Elmo&#8217;s fire by Hieronimus Cardanus in the second book of <hi>De Subtilitate</hi>. He says: &#8220;<foreign lang="en-1500" xml:lang="en-1500">Of the kynde of trewe fyer, is the fyer baule or &#383;tarre commonly cauled &#383;aynt Helen which is &#383;umtyme &#383;eene abowt the ma&#383;tes of &#383;hyppes, beinge of &#383;uche fyery nature that it &#383;umetyme melteth bra&#383;en ve&#383;&#383;els, and is a token of drownyng, fora&#383;much as this chaunceth only in great tempe&#383;tes.

Being little and swift moving they can do no damage as they could do if massed and of slow movement. St. Elmo&#8217;s fire is the popular name for the atmospheric electricity that gathers in the form of a star or brush about the masthead of ships and on the rigging. It was sometimes accompanied by a hissing noise and was considered as a good omen by sailors. The Greeks who observed this phenomenon wove it into the Castor and Pollux myth; and the French edition of Pigafetta&#8217;s relation published by Simon de <pb id="pb294" n="294"/>Colines has the passage (see Mosto, p. 54): &#8220;They saw the fires called Sainct Eline and Sainct Nicolas like blazing torches (whom the ancients called Castor and Pollux).&#8221; &#8220;Elmo&#8221; is said by some to be a corruption of &#8220;Helena,&#8221; the sister of Castor and Pollux, and the name &#8220;Hellene&#8221; or &#8220;Helen&#8221; was often given to the fire when only one light was visible. It is, however, more probably derived from St. Elmo, bishop of Formine who died about 304, and who is invoked by sailors on the Mediterranean. The phenomenon is also called fire of &#8220;St. Elias,&#8221; &#8220;St. Clara,&#8221; &#8220;St. Nicolas,&#8221; and &#8220;composite,&#8221; &#8220;composant,&#8221; and &#8220;corposant (<hi>i.e.</hi>, <hi>corpus sanctum</hi>).&#8221;

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n48" target="r48">48</ref></hi> The second bird mentioned is the stormy petrel (of the family <hi>Larid&#230;</hi> and genus <hi>Thalassidroma</hi>), which is found along all the Atlantic coasts and on some of the Pacific. The tale of the text was current among sailors (see Wilkes, <hi>U. S. Exploring Expedition</hi>, viii, pp. 402, 403). The cagassela (&#8220;cagaselo&#8221; in MS. 5,650) is the <hi>Stercorarius parasiticus</hi>, called also the jaeger, and by sailors &#8220;boatswain,&#8221; &#8220;teaser,&#8221; and &#8220;dung-hunter.&#8221; The last name arose from the belief, long held even by scientists, that this bird fed on the dung of gulls and terns. In reality it pursues the latter birds and compels them to disgorge the fish that they have swallowed. The flying-fish is either a species of <hi>Exoc&#339;tus</hi>, or the <hi>Scomberesox saurus</hi> of Europe and America, both of which feed in large schools and jump from the water to escape their enemies.

The first names of the country were Vera Cruz and Santa Cruz. Cape Santo Agostinho, mentioned below, lies in 8&#176; 21&#180; south latitude, and is the most eastern headland of South America. It was the first land of that continent to be discovered, being sighted at least as early as 1500 by Pinzon. Before sighting the above cape, Magalh&#227;es arrested Juan de Cartagena for insubordination and gave the command of the &#8220;San Antonio&#8221; to Antonio de Coca (see Guillemard&#8217;s <hi>Magellan</hi>,  p. 153).

In the flyleaf of the Italian original is the following: &#8220;Notices concerning the new world, with the charts of the countries discovered, written by Antonio Pigafeta, Venetian and knight of Rodi.

Of the coast he says: &#8220;The mountains are peaked and have many reefs about them. There are many rivers and ports in the said Brasil and San Tom&#233;, and some six leguas down the coast there are many bays running two leguas into the land. But the coast runs northeast and southwest to Cape Frio, and has many islands and rivers. Cape Frio is a very large river.... At the entrance of the said bay is a very large bay, and at the mouth a very low island, and inside it spreads out extensively and has many ports ... <pb id="pb296" n="296"/>and is called the bay of Santa Luc&#237;a.... In the said bay, one finds a well-disposed and numerous race, who go naked and trade for fishhooks, mirrors, and hawk&#8217;s bells with food.... We entered that place on the very day of St. Lucy, and stayed there until the day of St. John, namely, the twenty-seventh of the said month of December. On that day we went and took our course west southwest, and found seven islands. To the right of them is a bay called the bay of Los Reyes [<hi>i.e.</hi>, the Kings] which has a good entrance.&#8221; The &#8220;Roteiro&#8221; (Stanley, p. 1) says: &#8220;as soon as they sighted the other coast of Brazil, he steered to the south-east [<hi>sic</hi>] along the coast as far as Cabo-frio, which is in twenty-three degrees south latitude; and from this cape he steered to the west, a matter of thirty leagues, to make the Rio de Janeiro, which is in the same latitude as Cabo-frio, and they entered the said river on the day of St. Lucy, which was the 13th December, in which place they took in wood, and they remained there until the first octave of Christmas, which was the 26th of December of the same year.&#8221; Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 306) says: &#8220;Setting sail thence [<hi>i.e.</hi>, from Tenerife], the first land sighted was the cape of the shoals of Ambas.

Stanley cites the following (in the original) from the edition of 1536 which omits the above story: &#8220;At the first land at which we stopped, some female slaves whom we had brought in the ships from other countries and who were heavy with child, were taken with the pains of childbirth. Consequently, they went alone out of the ships, went ashore, and after having given birth, returned <pb id="pb299" n="299"/>immediately to the ships with their infants in their arms.&#8221; He also cites the following passage from the first French printed edition, which also narrates the above story of the girl: &#8220;At the first coast that we passed, some slave women gave birth. When they were in travail, they left the boat, after which they immediately returned, and nursed their children.&#8221; Stanley adds that this story of the slave women is improbable, as women were not allowed to come aboard ship.

In October, 1515, he sailed in command of an expedition in search of a southwest passage to India. He discovered Rio de la Plata which he explored as far as the region of the Charrua tribe, by whom he and some of his men were killed and eaten before September, 1516. The remnant of the expedition was conducted back to Spain by his brother-in-law.

Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 214) says: &#8220;We went to a port called San Julian, where we entered the last day of March, and where we stayed until the day of St. Bartholomew. The said port lies in a latitude of 49 and two-thirds degrees. We pitched the ships in that port.&#8221; Other writers give slightly different locations (see Mosto, p. 57, note 5). Antonio Brito, the Portuguese, whose MS. is preserved in the Torre do Tombo at Lisbon, writes in 1523 to the king of Portugal certain news obtained from some of the men of the &#8220;Trinidad.&#8221; His information as might be expected, is at times faulty.

Guillemard presents a picture of a Patagonian, as does also Wilkes (<hi>Narrative of U. S. Exploring Expedition</hi>, 1838&#8211;1842), i, facing p. 95. The latter describes Indians, whom the officers of the expedition thought to be Patagonians, and who were taller than average Europeans, as follows: &#8220;They had good figures and pleasant looking countenances, low foreheads, and high cheekbones, with broad faces, the lower part projecting; their hair was course and cut short on the crown leaving a narrow border of hair hanging down; over this they wore a kind of cap or band of skin or woolen yarn. The front teeth of all of them were very much worn, more apparent, however, in the old than in the young. On one foot they wore a rude skin sandal. Many of them had their faces painted in red and black stripes, with clay, soot, and ashes. Their whole appearance, together with their inflamed and sore eyes, was filthy and disgusting.&#8221; They showed that they had had previous communication with white men. Their food was fish and shellfish, and they carried bows and arrows and had dogs. Brinton (<hi>American Race</hi>, New York, 1891) says that &#8220;The Patagonians call themselves Chonek or Tzoneca, or Inaken (men, people), and by their Pampean neighbors are referred to as Tehuel-Che, southerners.&#8221; Many of them are &#8220;from six to six feet four inches in height, and built in proportion. In color they are a reddish brown, and have aquiline noses and good foreheads.&#8221; Ramon Lista (<hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Viage al pais de los Tehuel-Ches</hi>) gives the average height of the Patagonians as 1.854 m., hence the early accounts of their great stature are greatly exaggerated (Mosto, p. 57, note 6).

Their ancestral home was probably in northwestern India, whence they emigrated in successive waves. In many countries extreme and harsh measures were taken against them, especially in Germany, where they had appeared as early as 1417. They were never allowed a foothold in France, but have become a significant part of the population in Russia, Hungary, and Spain. In the latter country, where they are called Git&#225;nos (Egyptians), in spite of many severe laws passed against them until the reign of C&#225;rlos III, they continued, more fortunate than the Jews, to thrive. They are mentioned by Cervantes in his <hi>Don Quixote</hi> (pt. i, chap, xxx), but the name Git&#225;no had first appeared in a Spanish document of 1499, where their customs are described. <pb id="pb304" n="304"/>The few in Italy have been allowed to remain, and those in the Slavic countries and England were generally treated kindly.

 <pb id="pb305" n="305"/></p><p>The narrative of the mutiny as given by Navarrete (<hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Col. de viages</hi>, iv, pp. 34&#8211;38) which was compiled mainly from documents presented in the same volume and from Herrera, is as follows:

 </p><p>&#8220;March 31, the eve of Palm Sunday, Magallanes entered the port of San Julian, where he intended to winter, and consequently ordered the rations to be served by measure. In view of that and of the barrenness and cold of the country, the men asked Magallanes by various arguments to increase the rations or turn back, since there was no hope of finding the end of that country or any strait. But Magallanes replied that he would either die or accomplish what he had promised; that the king had ordered the voyage which he was to accomplish; and that he had to sail until he found that land or some strait which must surely exist; that in regard to the food, they had no reason to complain, since that bay had an abundance of good fish, good water, many game birds, and quantities of wood, and that bread and wine had not failed them, nor would fail them if they would abide by the rule regarding rations. Among other observations, he exhorted and begged them not to be found wanting in the valorous spirit which the Castilian nation had manifested and showed daily in greater affairs; and offering them corresponding rewards in the king&#8217;s name. By such means did he quiet the men.

 </p><p>&#8220;April 1, Palm Sunday, Magallanes summoned all his captains, officers, and pilots to go ashore to hear mass and afterward to dine in his ship. Alvaro de la Mezquita, Antonio de Coca, and all the men went to hear mass. Louis de Mendoza, Gaspar de Quesada, and Juan de Cartagena (the latter because he was a prisoner in Quesada&#8217;s keeping) did not go, however; and Alvaro de la Mezquita alone went to dine with Magallanes.

 </p><p>&#8220;During the night, Gaspar de Quesada and Juan de Cartagena with about thirty armed men of the ship &#8216;Concepcion&#8217; went to the &#8216;San Antonio,&#8217; where Quesada requested that the captain, Alvaro de la Mezquita, be surrendered to him, and told the crew of the ship to seize it, as they had already done with the &#8216;Concepcion&#8217; and &#8216;Victoria.&#8217; [He said] that they already knew how Magallanes had treated and was treating them, because they had asked him to fulfil the king&#8217;s orders; that they were lost men; and that they should help him make another request of Magallanes, and if necessary, seize him. Juan de Elorriaga, the master of the &#8216;San Antonio,&#8217; spoke in favor of his captain, Alvaro de la Mezquita, saying to Gaspar de Quesada: &#8216;I summon you, in God&#8217;s name and that of the king, Don C&#225;rlos, to go to your ship, for the present is no time to go through the ships with armed men; and I also summon you to release our captain.&#8217; Thereupon Quesada replied: &#8216;Must our deed remain unaccomplished because of this madman?&#8217; and drawing his dagger stabbed him four times in <pb id="pb306" n="306"/>the arm, thus overawing the men. Mezquita was kept prisoner, Elorriaga was cared for, Cartagena went to the ship &#8216;Concepcion,&#8217; while Quesada remained in the &#8216;San Antonio.&#8217; Thus were Quesada, Cartagena, and Mendoza masters of the three ships, &#8216;San Antonio,&#8217; &#8216;Concepcion,&#8217; and &#8216;Victoria.&#8217;

 </p><p>&#8220;Thereupon, they sent a message to Magallanes to the effect that they held three ships and the small boats of all five at their disposal in order to require him to fulfil his Majesty&#8217;s provisions. They said that they had done that in order that he might no longer illtreat them as he had done thitherto. If he would agree to fulfil his Majesty&#8217;s orders, they would obey his commands, and [said] that if they had thitherto treated him as a superior, they would thenceforth treat him as a master, and would be most respectful to him.

 </p><p>&#8220;Magallanes sent word to them to come to his ship, where he would hear them and do what was proper. They answered that they did not dare come lest he illtreat them, but that he should go to the ship &#8216;San Antonio,&#8217; where they would all assemble and decide definitely on what the king&#8217;s orders commanded.

 </p><p>&#8220;Magallanes believing that boldness was more useful than meekness in the face of such actions, determined to employ craft and force together. He kept the small boat of the ship &#8216;San Antonio&#8217; which was used for those negotiations, at his ship; and sent the alguacil, Gonzalo Gomez de Espinosa, in the skiff belonging to his ship, to the &#8216;Victoria,&#8217; with six men armed secretly and a letter for the treasurer, Luis de Mendoza, in which he told the latter to come to the flagship. While the treasurer was reading the letter and smiling as if to say &#8216;You don&#8217;t catch me that way,&#8217; Espinosa stabbed him in the throat, while another sailor stabbed him at the same instant on the head so that he fell dead. Magallanes, being a man with foresight, sent a boat under command of Duarte Barbosa, sobresaliente of the &#8216;Trinidad&#8217; with fifteen armed men, who entering the &#8216;Victoria&#8217; flung the banner to the breeze without any resistance. That happened on April 2. Then the &#8216;Victoria&#8217; approached the flagship, and they together immediately approached the &#8216;Santiago.&#8217;

 </p><p>&#8220;On the following day, the &#8216;San Antonio&#8217; and the &#8216;Concepcion&#8217; which were held by Quesada and Cartagena tried to put to sea, but it was necessary for them to pass close to the flagship which stood farthest out. The &#8216;San Antonio&#8217; raised two anchors, and being in danger with one, Quesada determined to free Alvaro de la Mezquita, whom he held a prisoner in his ship, in order to send him to Magallanes to arrange peace between them. Mezquita, however, told him that nothing would be obtained. Finally, they arranged that when they set sail, Mezquita should station himself forward and ask Magallanes as they approached his ship, <pb id="pb307" n="307"/>not to fire and that they would anchor provided affairs would be settled favorably.

 </p><p>&#8220;Before setting sail in the &#8216;San Antonio,&#8217; where they were endangered, as it was night and the crew were asleep, the ship dragged and ran foul of the flagship. The latter discharged some large and small shots and men leaped aboard the &#8216;San Antonio&#8217; crying, &#8216;For whom are you?&#8217; they responding, &#8216;For the king, our sovereign, and your Grace,&#8217; surrendered to Magallanes. The latter seized Quesada, the accountant, Antonio de Coca, and other sobresalientes who had gone to the &#8216;San Antonio&#8217; with Quesada. Then he sent to the &#8216;Concepcion&#8217; for Juan de Cartagena and imprisoned him with them.

 </p><p>&#8220;Next day Magallanes ordered the body of Mendoza taken ashore and had it quartered, and Mendoza cried as a traitor. On the seventh, he ordered Gaspar de Quesada beheaded and quartered with a like cry. That was done by Quesada&#8217;s own follower and sobresaliente, Luis de Molino, in order to save himself from hanging, for that sentence had been passed on him. Magallanes sentenced Juan de Cartagena and the lay priest, Pedro Sanchez de la Reina, who had been active in causing the men to mutiny, to be marooned in that country. He pardoned more than forty men who merited death, as they were needed to work the ships, and so that he might not excite hard feelings by the severity of the punishment.&#8221;

 </p><p>Brito&#8217;s account of the mutiny (Navarrete, iv, p. 307) is very brief and unsatisfactory: &#8220;In that port the captains began to ask him where he was taking them, especially one Juan de Cartagena, who said that he had a royal cedula naming him as associate with Magallanes, as Rui Falero would also have been, had he been there. Then they tried to rise against Magallanes and kill him, and go back to Castilla or to Rodas. From that point they went to the river of Santa Cruz, where they endeavored to put their plan in execution. But when Magallanes discovered their ill-considered attempt, for the captains said that they would kill him or take him prisoner, he ordered his ship armed and Juan de Cartagena arrested. As soon as the other captains saw their chief arrested they thought no longer of prosecuting their attempt. Magallanes, however, seized them all, for most of the crew were in his favor. He sent the merino or alguacil to kill Luis de Mendoza with his dagger, for the latter refused to be arrested; while he had another named Gaspar Quesada beheaded. When they set sail, he left Juan de Cartagena together with a secular priest ashore at a place where there were no inhabitants.&#8221;

 </p><p>Correa (Stanley, pp. 247&#8211;250) gives a different and imperfect account of the meeting.

 </p><p>Cf. with these accounts the one given by Guillemard (<hi>Magellan</hi>), pp. 162&#8211;174. When the &#8220;San Antonio&#8221; deserted, Esteban <pb id="pb308" n="308"/>Gomez is said to have rescued Cartagena and the priest. Jo&#227;o Serr&#227;o (after the loss of the &#8220;Santiago&#8221;) was given command of the &#8220;Concepcion,&#8221; Mesquita of the &#8220;San Antonio,&#8221; and Duarte Barbosa of the &#8220;Victoria,&#8221; all Portuguese (Guillemard, <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut supra</hi>, p. 179). It is rather singular that Sir Francis Drake should also have faced a mutiny in this same port, where Thomas Doughty was executed. That the history of Magalh&#227;es&#8217;s expedition was generally known is evident from the following: &#8220;<foreign lang="en-1500" xml:lang="en-1500">The next day after, being the twentieth of June, wee harboured ourselues againe in a very good harborough, called by Magellan <hi>Port S.

Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 307) says: &#8220;After this [<hi>i.e.</hi>, the mutiny], they wintered for three months; and Magallanes again ordered the ship &#8216;Santiago&#8217; to go ahead in order to explore.

The only vulgar name that I have been able to find for it is &#8216;robalo,&#8217; and this name is applied to it by the Spanish-speaking people of both sides of South America. Like most popular names, however, it is very misleading. &#8216;Robalo&#8217; is the Spanish name for the European bass, which is nearly related to our striped bass or rock bass. To that fish the robalo of South America has no affinity or real resemblance, and belongs to a very different family peculiar to the southern hemisphere&#8212;the <hi>Nototheniids</hi>. The so-called <hi>Eliginus maclovinus</hi> (properly, <hi>Eliginops maclovinus</hi>) is the most common and widely distributed species and probably the one obtained by the fleet of Magalh&#227;es.&#8221;

About 30 leguas farther on, we found a river named Santa Cruz, which we entered on the 26th of the same month. We stayed there until the day of San Lucas, the 18th of the month of October. We caught many fish there and got wood and water. That coast extends northeast by east and southwest by west, and is an excellent coast with good indentations.&#8221; The &#8220;Roteiro&#8221; (Stanley, p. 4) places the river Santa Cruz twenty leagues from San Julian and in about 50&#176;. That narrative says that the four remaining boats continued to pick up the wreckage of the &#8220;Santiago&#8221; until September 18. The name Santa Cruz was said to have been given to the river because they entered it on September 14, the day of the exaltation of the holy cross (see Stanley, p. 4, note 4, and Mosto, p. 60, note 7), but Kohl (Mosto, <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut supra</hi>) attributes the name to Jo&#227;o Serr&#227;o who was near that river on May 3, 1520, the day on which the church celebrates the feast of the finding of the holy cross. Navarrete (iv, p. 41) cites Herrera as authority for an eclipse of the sun that happened while at this river on October 11, 1520. Guillemard (<hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut supra</hi>, pp. 187, 188) is disinclined to believe the report, although he mentions an annular eclipse of the sun on October 20, 1520, which was however not visible in Patagonia. Navarrete (<hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut supra</hi>) says that Magalh&#227;es gave instructions to his captains here &#8220;saying that he would follow those coasts until finding a strait or the end of that continent, even if he had to go to a latitude of 75&#176;; that before abandoning that enterprise, the ships might be twice unrigged; and that after that he would go in search of Maluco toward the east and east northeast, by way of the cape of Buena Esperanza and the island of San Lorenzo.&#8221;

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n132" target="r132">132</ref></hi> This passage is as follows in MS. 5,650: &#8220;The said strait was a circular place surrounded with mountains (as I have said), and the majority of the sailors thought that there was no exit from it into the said Pacific Sea. But the captain-general declared that there was another strait which led out, and that he knew that well, for he had seen it on a marine chart of the king of Portugal. That map had been made by a renowned sailor and pilot, named Martin de Boesme. The said captain sent two of his ships forward&#8212;one named the &#8216;Sainct Anthoine,&#8217; and the other the &#8216;Conception&#8217;&#8212;in order that they might look for and discover the exit from the said strait, which was called the cape de la Baya.&#8221;

 </p><p>Martin de Behaim (Beham, Behem, Behemira, Behen, B&#339;hem, B&#339;hm) was born about 1459 (some say also in 1430 or 1436) of a family originally from Bohemia, in Nuremberg, Germany, and died at Lisbon, July 29, 1506. He was a draper in Flanders, 1477&#8211;1479, after which he went to Lisbon (1480) where he became <pb id="pb311" n="311"/>acquainted with Columbus. In 1484 he was chosen geographer of Diego Cam&#8217;s expedition to Western Africa. On his return, he received the order of knighthood in the military order of Christ of Portugal; after which he went to the island of Fayal in the Azores where he became interested in colonization and agriculture, and married the daughter of the governor. In 1491 he returned to Germany, where he lived at Nuremberg until 1493, and where, at the request of his townsmen, he constructed an immense globe on the information of Ptolemy, Strabo, and others, which contains many errors (see facsimile in Guillemard), In 1493 he returned to Lisbon, and in 1494 to Fayal, where he remained until 1506, when he went to Lisbon. Many myths sprung up about him, such that he had visited America before Columbus and the straits of Magellan before Magalh&#227;es, the latter of whom he may have known at Lisbon. See Rose, <hi>New Biographical Dictionary</hi> (London, 1848); <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande Encyclop&#233;die</hi> (Paris, Lamirault et Cie.); and Guillemard, pp. 73, 74.

His desertion occurred probably <pb id="pb312" n="312"/>in the first part of November, and was perhaps directly due to pique at what he considered lack of appreciation from Magalh&#227;es. Conspiring with Ger&#243;nimo Guerra, the notary, who was elected captain of the &#8220;San Antonio&#8221; they made off with that ship, and after imprisoning Alvaro de Mezquita, returned to Spain, anchoring at Sevilla May 6, 1521. There Gomez was imprisoned after the return of the &#8220;Victoria,&#8221; but was liberated, and in 1524 proposed an expedition to discover a northwest passage. An expedition having been fitted out by C&#225;rlos I, he coasted Florida and the eastern coast, as far as Cape Cod, and returned to Spain in 1525. See <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande Encyclop&#233;die</hi>; Navarrete, iv, pp. 42&#8211;45, and 201&#8211;208; and Guillemard, <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut supra</hi>, pp. 203&#8211;205.

 </p><p>Brito&#8217;s story of the exploration of the strait and the loss of the &#8220;San Antonio&#8221; (Navarrete, iv, pp. 307, 308) is as follows: &#8220;They left that place [<hi>i.e.</hi>, the river of Santa Cruz] on October 20, and went to enter a strait of which they had no knowledge. The entrance of the strait extends for about 15 leguas; and after they had entered, it seemed to them that it was all land-locked, and they accordingly anchored there. Magallanes sent a Portuguese pilot named Juan Carballo ashore with orders to ascend a mountain in order to ascertain whether there was any outlet. Carballo returned saying that it appeared land-locked to him. Thereupon Magallanes ordered the ships &#8216;San Antonio&#8217; and the &#8216;Concepcion&#8217; to go in advance in order to explore the strait. After having gone ahead for about 30 leguas, they returned to tell Magallanes that the river went farther but that they could not tell where it would take them. Upon receiving that information Magallanes weighed anchor with all three ships, and advanced along the strait until reaching the point to which the others had explored. Then he ordered the &#8216;San Antonio&#8217; of which Alvaro de Mezquito, his cousin, was captain, and Esteban Gomez, a Portuguese pilot, to go ahead and explore a southern channel that opened in the strait. That ship did not return to the others and it is not known whether it returned to Castilla or whether it was wrecked. Magallanes proceeded with his remaining ships until he found an exit.&#8221; Correa&#8217;s account of the desertion of the &#8220;San Antonio&#8221; is as usual with him, inadequate, and evidently based on hearsay evidence (see Stanley, p. 250).

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n144" target="r144">144</ref></hi> Guillemard (p. 206) conjectures from the records of Albo, Pigafetta, and Herrera that the river of Sardines is Port Gallant which is located on the Brunswick Peninsula, opposite the Charles Islands. Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 215) says that after taking the <pb id="pb313" n="313"/>course to the northwest they sailed about 15 leagues before anchoring.

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n145" target="r145">145</ref></hi> Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 216) says that the two capes at the exit of the strait were called Fermosa and Deseado, this latter being Cape Pillar (see Guillemard, map facing p. 198).

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n146" target="r146">146</ref></hi> MS. 5,650 adds: &#8220;which were on the other side.&#8221;

Pigafetta errs in calling him a Spaniard (see p. 183), though he may have become a naturalized Spaniard, since the register speaks of him as a citizen of Sevilla. One document (Navarrete, iv, p. 155) calls him a Portuguese pilot, and Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 308) a Castilian. He was an experienced navigator and captain, and had served under Vasco da Gama, Almeida, and Albuquerque. Vasco da Gama (on his second voyage, 1502&#8211;1503) made him captain of the ship &#8220;Pomposa&#8221; which was built in Mozambique where he was left to attend to Portuguese affairs. On this expedition he saw the coast of Brazil for the first time, for Vasco da Gama&#8217;s fleet, ere doubling the Cape of Good Hope, crossed to the Brazilian coast, which they followed as far as Cape Santo Agostinho. He fought bravely in the battle of Cananor under Almeida (March 16, 1506, in which Magalh&#227;es also participated). He was chief captain of three caravels in August, 1510, in Eastern water, and was in the Java seas in 1512, but must have returned to Portugal soon after that, for he was there in 1513; although he seems to have been appointed clerk at the fortress of Calicut in the latter year. He embarked with Magalh&#227;es as captain and pilot of the &#8220;Santiago,&#8221; but after the wreck of that vessel near port San Julian was given command of the &#8220;Concepcion,&#8221; in which he later explored the strait. Failing to dissuade Magalh&#227;es from attacking the natives of Matan, he became commander, with Duarte Barbosa, of the fleet at Magalh&#227;es&#8217;s death, and was murdered by the Cebuans after the treacherous banquet given by them to the fleet. See Guillemard (<hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut supra</hi>), and Stanley&#8217;s <hi>Three voyages of Vasco da Gama</hi> (Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1869).

The anonymous Portuguese (Stanley, p. 31) says that the strait was called the &#8220;Strait of Victoria, because the ship &#8216;Victoria&#8217; was the first that had seen it: some called it the Strait of Magalhaens because our captain was named Fernando de Magalhaens.&#8221; Castanheda says that Magalh&#227;es gave it the name of &#8220;bay of All Saints&#8221; because it was discovered on November 1; and San Martin in his reply to Magalh&#227;es&#8217;s request for opinions regarding the continuance of the expedition calls it &#8220;channel of All Saints:&#8221; but this name was first applied to only one gulf or one branch and later extended to the entire channel. This name is found in the instructions given for the expedition of Sebastian Cabot in 1527, and in the map made that same year at Sevilla by the Englishman Robert Thorne. Sarmiento de Gamboa petitioned Felipe II that it be called &#8220;strait of the Mother of God.&#8221; It was also called &#8220;strait of Martin Behaim.&#8221; The anonymous Portuguese (Stanley, p. 31) says that the strait is 400 miles long.

 </p><p>In the above list, <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">chen</hi> corresponds in the Italian MS. to <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">ehen</hi>, the equivalent of &#8220;no;&#8221; <hi>theu</hi> is &#8220;ship&#8221; in the above, and &#8220;snow&#8221; in the Italian; <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">courire</hi> (the equivalent of <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">covrire</hi> or <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">coprire</hi>, &#8220;to cover&#8221;) in the Italian, becomes <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">courir</hi> (&#8220;to run&#8221;) in MS. 5,650. All are to be regarded as errors of the French. Certain words are left in Italian in MS. 5,650, which are as follows: <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">la copa</hi>; <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">alcalcagno</hi>; (Italian MS. <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">al calcagno</hi>); <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">homo squerzo</hi> (Italian MS. <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">sguerco</hi>); <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a la pignate</hi> (Italian MS. <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">pigniata</hi>); <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">alstruzzo vcelo</hi> (Italian MS. <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">al seruzo ucelo</hi>); and <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">alcocinare</hi> (Italian MS. <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">al co&#231;inare</hi>). Stanley offers this as proof that MS. 5,650 was written by Pigafetta, and not translated from his Italian, but it furnishes no evidence that Pigafetta even saw the French version of his relation. It must be remembered that Stanley did not himself see the Italian MS. but only the Amoretti mutilation of it (from which, and from MS. 5,650, he reproduces the vocabulary, without English translation); and hence bases his observations on that and the conjectures of its editor. Stanley points out the fact that Amoretti has omitted several words of this list, but they are all in the Italian MS. A sad blunder has been made by Stanley in his transcription of <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La pouldre dherbe qui mangent</hi> whose Patagonian equivalent is <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">capac</hi>. He transcribes as follows: <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la pouldre d&#8217;herbe</hi> with Patagonian equivalent <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">qui</hi> (which it is to be noted is only the wrong form of the French relative), and <hi>mangent</hi> with Patagonian equivalent <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">capac</hi>, explaining <hi>mangent</hi> in a footnote as &#8220;Food, the root used as bread.&#8221; Stanley also makes the following mistranscriptions: <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">orescho</hi> for <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">oresche</hi> (&#8220;nostrils&#8221;); <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">canneghin</hi> for <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">caimeghin</hi> (&#8220;palm of the hand&#8221;); <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">ochy</hi> for <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">ochii</hi> (&#8220;bosom&#8221;); <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">scancos</hi> for <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">scaneos</hi> (&#8220;testicles&#8221;); <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">hou</hi> for <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">hoii</hi> (&#8220;buttocks&#8221;); <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">ohoy</hi> for <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">ohon</hi> (&#8220;pulse&#8221;); <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">cartschem</hi> for <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">cartscheni</hi> (&#8220;sole of the foot&#8221;); <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">chol</hi> for <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">thol</hi> (&#8220;heart&#8221;); <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">om</hi> for <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">oni</hi> (&#8220;wind&#8221;); <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">aschame</hi> for <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">aschanie</hi> (&#8220;earthen pot&#8221;); <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">oamaghei</hi> for <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">oamaghce</hi> (&#8220;to fight&#8221;); <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">amet</hi> for <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">amel</hi> (&#8220;black&#8221;); and <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">ixecoles</hi> for <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">jrocoles</hi> (&#8220;to cook&#8221;). Amoretti has also made many errors (see Stanley&#8217;s <hi>First Voyage</hi>, pp. 62, 63). Mosto, who is on the whole a faithful transcriber, has <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">sacancos</hi> as the Patagonian equivalent of <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">a li testiculi</hi>; <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">om jani</hi> for <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">a li sui</hi>, the correct forms of the latter being <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">jani</hi> and <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">a li sui oui</hi>; and <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">tcrechai</hi> for the equivalent of &#8220;red cloth.&#8221; Eden (p. 252) gives only the following words: &#8220;breade, Capar: water, Oli: redde clothe, Cherecai: red colour, Cheiche: blacke colour, Amel.&#8221;

 </p><p>Mosto (p. 63, note 8) gives the following words from the <pb id="pb317" n="317"/>vocabulary of the Tehuel-ches compiled by the second lieutenant of the ship &#8220;Roncagli,&#8221; which correspond almost exactly with those given by Pigafetta.

See also lists of words in Brinton (<hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut supra</hi>), p. 364, from the Patagonian and Fuegian languages. The vocabularies given by Horatio Hale (Wilkes&#8217;s <hi>U. S. Exploring Expedition</hi>, 1838&#8211;1842, Philadelphia, 1846, viii, pp. 651&#8211;656) bear no resemblance to Pigafetta&#8217;s vocabulary. Hale says that guttural sounds are frequent among the Indians of the Patagonian district.

The cardinal points in all of Pigafetta&#8217;s charts are the reverse of the ordinary, the north being below and the south above. MS. 5,650 precedes this chart (which there occupies folio 21a) by the words: &#8220;Below is depicted the strait of Patagonie.&#8221; Immediately following this chart in the Italian MS. (folio 15a) is the chart of the <hi>Ysole Infortunate</hi> (&#8220;Unfortunate Isles;&#8221; see p. 92). These islands are shown in MS. 5,650 on folio 23a, with the following notice: &#8220;Here are shown the two islands called &#8216;Unfortunate Islands.&#8217;&#8221; The charts in the Italian MS. are brown or dull black on a blue ground.

At that council Andr&#233; de San Martin, pilot in the &#8220;San Antonio,&#8221; advised that they continue explorations until the middle of January, 1521, and then return to Spain; and urged that no farther southward descent be made, and that navigation along so dangerous coasts be only by day, in order that the crew might have some rest (Navarrete, iv, pp. 45&#8211;49).

One was called St. Peter (in 18&#176;) and the other the island of Tiburones (in 14&#176;). Transylvanus (<hi rend="sc">Vol. I</hi>, p. 321), Herrera, and Oviedo, say that the three vessels stopped two days at those islands for supplies, but Albo&#8217;s journal (Navarrete, iv, p. 218) indicates that no stop was made there. The &#8220;Roteiro&#8221; (Stanley, p. 9), gives the latitude of these islands as 18&#176; or 19&#176; and 13&#176; or 14&#176;. Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 218) says that the first was discovered January 24 in 16&#176; 15&#180;, and was called San Pablo, because that was the date of St. Paul&#8217;s conversion; and the island of Tiburones was discovered February 4, in 10&#176; 40&#180;, at a distance of 9&#176; (<hi>sic</hi>) from the former. Eden (p. 253) says that the second island lay in 5&#176;. These two islands were probably Puka-puka (the <foreign lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Honden Eyland</foreign> of the Dutch atlases) of the Tuamotu group, located in latitude <pb id="pb319" n="319"/>14&#176; 45&#180; south, and longitude 138&#176; 48&#180; west; and Flint Island of the Manihiki group, located in latitude 11&#176; 20&#180; south and longitude 151&#176; 48&#180; west. The latter is still uninhabited, but the former contains a population of over four hundred. See <hi>ante</hi>, note 163. See Guillemard, p. 220, and Mosto, p. 65, note 6.

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n172" target="r172">172</ref></hi> MS. 5,650 reads: &#8220;now at the stern, now at the windward side, or otherwise.&#8221; Amoretti changes this passage completely, reading: &#8220;According to our measurement of the distance that we made with the chain astern, we ran from sixty to seventy leagues daily.&#8221; Many basing themselves on this passage of Amoretti, have believed that the log was in use at the time of the first circumnavigation. Dr. Breusing (<hi lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Catena a poppa bei Pigafetta und die Logge</hi>, in &#8220;<foreign lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft f&#252;r Erdkunde zu Berlin</foreign>,&#8221; 1869, iv, pp. 107&#8211;115) believes that the &#8220;stern chain (<hi>catena poppa</hi>) is not the log properly so-called, but an instrument for determining the angle of the ship&#8217;s leeway, an opinion accepted also by Gelcich in his <hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">La scoperta d&#8217;America e Cristoforo Colombo nella letteratura moderna</hi> (Gorizia, 1890). L&#8217;Vzielle (<hi lang="it" xml:lang="it">Studi bibliogr. e biogr. sulla storia della geogr. in Italia</hi>, Roma, 1875, part ii, introduction, pp. 294&#8211;296), combats that opinion, as well as the idea that the log is meant. The difficulty of the passage, he says, hinges on the word <hi>ho</hi> and whether it is interpreted as a verb or a conjunction.

See Mosto, p. 66, note<corr sic=","/> 1. L&#8217;Vzielli&#8217;s opinion is the most probable, for although the log is mentioned by Purchas as early as 1607, its use did not become general until 1620. An instrument used to measure the rates of vessels is mentioned as early as 1577, but it was very deficient.

They were first observed by the Arabians. The Portuguese pilots probably called them at first &#8220;clouds of the cape.&#8221; (Mosto, p. 66, note 2). The Southern Cross, which resembles a lute rather than a cross, was first erected into a constellation by Royer in 1679, although often spoken of before as a cross. Only one of its five principal stars belongs to the first magnitude. The cross is only 6&#176; in extent north and south and less than that east and west.

We stayed there that night and in the morning went toward the south southwest for about 12 leguas, as far as 10 and one-third degrees. At that point we entered a channel between two islands, one of which is called Matan and the other Subu. Subu, as well as the islands of Mazava and Suluan extend north by east and south by west. Between Subu and Seilani we spied a very lofty land lying to the north, which is called Baibai. It is said to contain considerable gold and to be well stocked with food, and so great an extent of land that its limits are unknown. From Mazava, Seilani, and Subu, on the course followed toward the south, look out for the many shoals, which are very bad. On that account a canoe which was guiding us along that course, refused to go ahead. From the beginning of the channel of Subu and Matan, we turned west by a middle channel and reached the city of Subu. There we anchored and made peace, and the people there gave us rice, millet, and meat. We stayed there for a considerable time. The king and queen of that place and many of the inhabitants readily became Christians.&#8221; The &#8220;Roteiro&#8221; (Stanley, p. 11) says that the king of Macangar (<hi>i.e.</hi>, Mazaua) conducted the Spaniards &#8220;a matter of thirty leagues to another island named Cabo [<hi>i.e.</hi>, Ceb&#250;], which is in ten degrees, and in this island Fernando de Magalh&#227;es did what he pleased with the consent of <pb id="pb331" n="331"/>the country.&#8221; Brito says merely (Navarrete, iv, p. 308): &#8220;After that, after passing amid many islands, they reached one called Mazaba, which lies in 9 degrees.

See Stanley&#8217;s <hi>Vasco da Gama</hi> (Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1869); Birch&#8217;s <hi>Alboquerque</hi> (Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1875&#8211;1884); Jones and Badger&#8217;s <hi>Ludovico di Varthema</hi> (Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1863), pp. 135&#8211;177; also Grey&#8217;s <hi>Travels of Pietro della Valle</hi> (Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1892), pp. 344, 345, note.

 </p><p>Malacca, or more correctly M&#226;laka is the name of an ancient territory and city, which was probably first settled by Javanese, and is possibly derived from &#8220;Malayu&#8221; meaning in Javanese &#8220;to run&#8221; or &#8220;fugitive.&#8221; At an early period Malacca fell under the sway of the Siamese. The city, located on both sides of the Malacca River, and only one hundred and thirty miles northwest of Singapore (which has usurped the great volume of trade once centering at Malacca) was founded about 1250 <hi rend="sc">A.D.</hi> The first European to visit the city was Varthema, about the year 1505. It was captured by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and they held it (1580&#8211;1640 under Spanish control) until 1641 when it was captured by the Dutch, who had unsuccessfully besieged it, with the aid of the king of Jahor, in 1606. The English obtained possession of it in 1795, and still hold it, although the Dutch possessed it from 1818&#8211;1825. For descriptions and history of Malacca, see the following Hakluyt Society publications: Stanley&#8217;s <hi>East Africa and Malabar</hi> (London, 1866), pp. 190&#8211;195; Birch&#8217;s <hi>Alboquerque</hi>, iii, pp. 71&#8211;90 (and other citations); Burnell and Tiele&#8217;s <hi>Linschoten</hi> (London, 1885), i, pp. 104&#8211;106; Gray&#8217;s <hi>Voyage of Fran&#231;ois Pyrard</hi> (London, 1888), part i, p. ii. Also see Crawfurd&#8217;s <hi>Dictionary</hi>, pp. 238&#8211;249.

 </p><p>The terms India Major (Greater India) and India Minor (Lesser India) are differently applied by different authors. Schiltbergen applied the term Lesser India to the northern portion of the peninsula on this side of the Ganges, while the southern portion of the peninsula was termed Greater India. Marco Polo&#8217;s Lesser India extended from Makran to and including the Coromandel coast, and his Greater India extended from the Coromandel coast to Cochin China, while Middle India was Abyssinia. <pb id="pb333" n="333"/>Mosto wrongly identifies India Major with the present Indian empire. See Telfer&#8217;s <hi>Johann Schiltberger</hi> (Hakluyt Society publications, 1879). Friar Jordanus (<hi>Wonders of the East</hi>, Hakluyt Society edition, London, 1863), describes (pp. 11&#8211;45) India the Less, India the Greater, and India Tertia. Yule points out that Jordanus&#8217;s Lesser India embraces Sindh, and probably Mekran, and India along the coast as far as some point immediately north of Malabar. Greater India extends from Malabar very indefinitely to the eastward, for he makes it include Champa. India Tertia is the east of Africa below Abyssinia. Thus Jordanus just reverses the Lesser and Greater Indias of Marco Polo. Ramusio who gives the <hi>Summary of Kingdoms</hi> of an old Portuguese geographer, ends First India at Mangalore, and Second India at the Ganges. Benjamin of Tudela speaks of &#8220;Middle India which is called Aden.&#8221; Conti divides India into three parts: the first extending from Persia to the Indus, the second from the Indus to the Ganges, and the third all the land beyond. Pliny discusses whether Mekran and other lands belonged to India or Ariana.

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n312" target="r312">312</ref></hi> The account of the baptism of the king is considerably abridged in MS. 5,650 where it reads as follows: &#8220;Then the captain began to address the king through the interpreter, in order that he might incite him to the faith of Jesus Christ. He told him that if he wished to become a good Christian (as he had signified on the preceding day), that he must have all the idols of his country burned and set up a cross in their place, which they were all to adore daily on both knees, with hands clasped and raised toward the heaven. The captain showed the king how he was to make the sign of the cross daily. In reply the king and all his men said that they would obey the captain&#8217;s commandment, and do all that he told them. The captain took the king <pb id="pb336" n="336"/>by the hand, and they walked to the platform. At his baptism the captain told the king that he would call him Dom Charles, after the emperor his sovereign. He named the prince Dom Fernand, after the brother of the said emperor, and the king of Mazzaua, Jehan. He gave the name of Christofle to the Moro, while he called each of the others by names according to his fancy. Thus before the mass fifty men [<hi>sic</hi>: but an error of the French adapter for five hundred] were baptized. At the conclusion of mass, the captain invited the king and the others of his chief men to dine with him, but he would not accept. However, he accompanied the captain to the shore, where, at his arrival, the ships discharged all the artillery. Then embracing they took leave of one another.&#8221; Eden gives the number baptized as five hundred men.

They were rynges of gold abowt theyr priuie members.&#8221; In the description of the battle in Matan, Eden says that each of the three divisions of the islanders contained &#8220;two thou&#383;and and fiftie men armed with bowes, arrowes, dartes and iauelins hardened at the poyntes with fyer.</foreign>&#8221;

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n345" target="r345">345</ref></hi> To this point the Italian MS. and MS. 5,650 agree approximately. The story of the battle in the latter MS., however, is much abridged and much less graphic. It is as follows: &#8220;They replied that they had bamboo spears and stakes burned and hardened in the fire, and that we could attack them when we wished. At daybreak, forty-nine of us leaped into the water, in the place whither we had thus gone, at a distance of more than three [<hi>sic</hi>] crossbow flights before we could reach shore, for the boats could <pb id="pb339" n="339"/>not approach nearer because of the rocks and reefs which were in the water. Thus we reached land, and attacked them. They were arranged in three divisions, of more than one thousand five hundred persons. We shot many arrows at them from a distance, but it was in vain, for they received them on their shields. They leaped hither and thither in such a way that scarce could we wound one of them. On the other hand, our artillery in the boats was so far away from us that it could not aid us. Those people seeing that, and that the captain had had some of their houses burned in order to inspire them with terror, and having become more enraged, threw so many iron pointed spears at us, and shot so many arrows even at the captain himself that we could defend ourselves with difficulty. Finally, having been driven by them quite down to the shore, and while our captain was fighting bravely although wounded in the leg with an arrow, one of those Indians hurled a poisoned bamboo lance into his face which laid him stiff and dead. Then they pressed upon us so closely that we were forced to retire to our boats and to leave the dead body of the captain-general, with our other killed.&#8221; The eulogy on the dead commander is approximately the same in both MSS., except at the end, where MS. 5,650 reads: &#8220;Eight of our men died there with him, and four Indians, who had become Christians. Of the enemy fifteen were killed by the artillery of the ships, which had at last come to our aid, while many of us were wounded.&#8221;

 </p><p>Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 308) says of the stay at Ceb&#250; and the death of Magalh&#227;es: &#8220;They stayed there about one month, and the majority of the people and the king became Christians. The king of Zub&#243; ordered the kings of the other islands to come to him, but inasmuch as two of them refused to come, Magallanes, as soon as he learned it, resolved to go to fight with them, and went to an island called Math&#225;. He set fire to a village, and not content with that, set out for a large settlement, where he, his servant, and five Castilians were killed in combat with the savages. The others, seeing their captain dead, went back to their boats.&#8221;

The account of the battle is as follows: &#8220;Fernan de Magalh&#227;es desired that the other kings, neighbours to this one, should become subject to this who had become Christian: and these did not choose to yield such obedience. Fernan de Magalh&#227;es seeing that, got ready one night with his boats, and burned the villages of those who would not yield the said obedience; and a matter of ten or twelve days after this was done, he sent to a village about <pb id="pb340" n="340"/>half a league from that which he had burned, which is named Matam, and which is also an island, and ordered them to send him at once three goats, three pigs, three loads of rice, and three loads of millet for provisions for the ships; they replied that for each article which he sent to ask them three of, they would send to him by twos, and if he was satisfied with this they would at once comply, if not, it might be as he pleased, but that they would not give it. Because they did not choose to grant what he demanded of them, Fernan de Magalh&#227;es ordered three boats to be equipped with a matter of fifty or sixty men, and went against the said place, which was on the 28th day of April, in the morning; there they found many people, who might well be as many as three thousand or four thousand men, who fought with such a good will that the said Fernan de Magalh&#227;es was killed there, with six of his men, in the year 1521.&#8221;

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n351" target="r351">351</ref></hi> MS. 5,650 gives this name as Duart Bobase, although lower it is spelled Barbase. Duarte or Odoardo Barbosa, the son of Diogo Barbosa, who after serving in Portugal, became alcaide of the Sevilla arsenal, was born at Lisbon at the end of the fifteenth century. He spent the years 1501&#8211;1516 in the Orient, the result of that stay being his <hi lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Livro emque d&#224; rela&#231;&#227;o do que viu e ouviu no Oriente</hi>, which was first published at Lisbon in 1813 in vol. vii of <hi lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Collec&#231;ao de noticias para a historia et geographia das na&#231;&#245;es ultramarinas</hi>, and its translation by Stanley, <hi>A description of the coasts of East Africa and Malabar</hi> (Hakluyt Society publications, London, 1866). He became a clerk in the Portuguese factory at Cananor under his uncle Gil Fernandez Barbosa, and became so expert in the Malabar language that he was said to speak it even better than the natives. On account of his facility in the language he had been appointed commissioner by Nuno da Cunha to negotiate peace with the Zamorin. He was commissioned in 1515 to oversee the construction of some galleys by Alboquerque. While at Sevilla, Magalh&#227;es lived in the household of Diogo Barbosa, where he married Duarte&#8217;s sister Beatriz. Duarte embarked on the &#8220;Trinidad&#8221; as a sobresaliente, and it was he who captured the &#8220;Victoria&#8221; from the mutineers at Port St. Julian, after which he became captain of that vessel. Failing to recover Magalh&#227;es body from the natives of Mact&#225;n, he was <pb id="pb341" n="341"/>himself slain at Ceb&#250; at the fatal banquet May 1, 1521. Besides the above book, which is a most valuable contribution to early Oriental affairs, there is extant in the Torre do Tombo a letter written by him from Cananor, January 12, 1513, complaining of the Portuguese excesses.

 </p><p>In regard to Jo&#227;o Serr&#227;o&#8217;s death, Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 309) says: &#8220;As soon as the men in the ships saw that slaughter, they hoisted their anchors, and tried to set sail in order to return to Burneo. At that juncture, the savages brought Juan Serrano, one of those whom they wished to ransom, and asked two guns and two bahars of copper for him, besides some Brittanias or linens such as they carried in the ships as merchandise of trade and barter. Serrano told them to take him to the ship and he would give them what they asked, but they, on the contrary, insisted that those things be taken ashore. But [the men in the ships] fearing another act of treachery like the past, set sail, and abandoned that man there, and nothing more was heard of him.&#8221;

 <pb id="pb342" n="342"/></p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n361" target="r361">361</ref></hi> The &#8220;Roteiro&#8221; (Stanley, p. 13) says nothing about the banquet, but says that the men, twenty-eight in number, counting the two captains, went ashore to ask pilots to Borneo, whereupon the natives, who had determined upon their course of action attacked and killed them. Peter Martyr (Mosto, p. 81, note 5) asserts that the violation of the women by the sailors was the cause of the massacre. Concerning the number killed, Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 309) says that thirty-five or thirty-six men went ashore, and Castanheda and Gomara say thirty, the last asserting that a like number were made slaves, of whom eight were sold in China. Peter Martyr places the number of the slain at twelve. Navarrete (iv, pp. 66, 67) gives the names of those massacred as follows:

The general Visayan word for &#8220;man&#8221; is <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">tao</hi> or <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">tauo</hi>, although Mallat gives a form <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">dala</hi>, which may correspond to the <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">lac</hi> of Pigafetta (but see <hi rend="sc">Vol. V</hi>, p. 123, where the origin of the words <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">lalac</hi>, &#8220;man,&#8221; and <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">babaye</hi>, &#8220;woman,&#8221; are given by Loarca). <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">Babaye</hi> (<hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">babae</hi>) is the general word for &#8220;woman&#8221; or &#8220;married woman;&#8221; while <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">binibini</hi> is given by Mallat as the Tag&#225;log equivalent of &#8220;girl,&#8221; and by Santos in his <hi lang="es" xml:lang="es">Vocabulario de la lengua tagala</hi> (Manila, 1835) as the equivalent of &#8220;influential woman.&#8221; <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">Liog</hi> is used for both &#8220;throat&#8221; and &#8220;neck.&#8221; <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">Tian</hi> is properly &#8220;belly,&#8221; and the mistake would arise naturally in Pigafetta pointing to himself when desiring the word for &#8220;body,&#8221; which would be construed by the natives to that particular part toward which he happened to point. <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">Boto</hi> is used for both the male and female generative organs, especially the latter, as well as for the testicles. <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">Britiis</hi> corresponds to both &#8220;shin&#8221; and &#8220;calf of the leg.&#8221; <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">Iro</hi> denotes also the civet cat. <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">Bulan</hi> the equivalent of Pigafetta&#8217;s <hi lang="xx" xml:lang="xx">bolon</hi> is the word for &#8220;moon&#8221; instead of &#8220;star.&#8221; The occurrence of what are today Tag&#225;log forms in Pigafetta&#8217;s list shows how the various dialects shade into one another and how the one has retained words that have sunk into disuse in the other.

Toward the western end of Subu lies another island, by name, Panilongo, which is inhabited by blacks. That island and Subu contain gold and considerable ginger. The former lies in 9 and one-third degrees and Subu in 10 and one-third degrees. Accordingly we left that channel and went 10 leguas south and anchored in the island of Bohol. There we made two ships of the three, burning the third, because we had no men. The last-named island lies in 9 and one-half degrees. We left Bohol and sailed southwest toward Quipit, and anchored at that settlement on the right hand side of a river. On the northwest and open side are two islets which lie in 8 and one-half degrees. We could get no food there, for the people had none, but we made peace with them. That island of Quipit contains a quantity of gold, ginger, and cinnamon. Accordingly, we determined to go in search of food. The distance from the headland of Quipit to the first islands is about 112 leguas. It and the islands lie in an east by north and south by west direction; and this island [<hi>i.e.</hi>, Mindanao] extends quite generally east and west.&#8221;

 </p><p>The &#8220;Roteiro&#8221; (Stanley, p. 14) calls the port of Quipit (which is located on the northeastern coast of Mindanao) Capyam or Quype. Carvalho gave the boat of the burned ship to the inhabitants of that place. Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 309) says that they learned the location of Borneo at Mindanao. Quipit becomes Gibith in Transylvanus, Chipico in Peter Martyr, and Quepindo in Barros (see Mosto, p. 84, note 2).

We anchored in the northern part of that island, where we asked for the location of the island of Poluan, in order to get provisions of rice, for that island contains it in abundance, and many ships are laden there for other districts. Accordingly we sailed west northwest and came across the headland of the island of Poluan.&#8221; The &#8220;Roteiro&#8221; (Stanley, p. 14) calls Cagaiam, Caram. It is the island of Cagayan Sulu, which lies northeast of Borneo.

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n398" target="r398">398</ref></hi> Occurrences at Palawan are given as follows by Albo (Navarrete, iv, pp. 221, 222): &#8220;Then we sailed north by east along the coast [of Palawan] until we reached a village called Saocao, where we made peace. Its inhabitants were Moros. We went to another village of Cafres, where we bartered for a considerable quantity of rice, and consequently laid in a good supply of provisions. That coast extends northeast and southwest. The headland of its northeastern part lies in 9 and one-third degrees, and that of the southwestern part in 8 and one-third degrees. Then on returning to the southwest quite to the headland of this island, we found an island near which is a bay. In this course and along Poluan many shoals are found. This headland lies east and west with Quipit and northeast by east and southwest by west with Quagayan.&#8221;

 </p><p>The &#8220;Roteiro&#8221; (Stanley, pp. 15&#8211;17) gives a fuller account of occurrences at Palawan. At the first settlement at which they attempt to land, the natives prove hostile, whereupon they go toward another island, but contrary weather compelling them to anchor near Palawan, they are invited ashore on that island by the people of another village. There one of the soldiers, Joam de Campos, lands alone in order to get provisions. Being received kindly at this port, named Dyguasam (perhaps Puerto Princesa), the people set about preparing provisions for the strangers. Then going to another nearby village, where Carvalho makes peace with the chief, provisions of rice, goats, and swine are bought. At the latter village, a Portuguese-speaking negro who has been baptized at the Moluccas, is met, who promises <pb id="pb351" n="351"/>to guide them to Borneo, but he fails them at the last moment. Capturing a prau and three Moros near the former village, they are guided to Borneo. Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 309) says that the two ships remained a month in Palawan, &#8220;a rich country, where they got new directions about Burneo, and captured two men to guide them there.&#8221;

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n419" target="r419">419</ref></hi> The journey to Borneo, events there, and a description of Borneo are thus described by Albo (Navarrete, iv, p. 222): &#8220;We sailed from Poluan to Borney. Coasting the above named island [<hi>i.e.</hi>, Poluan] to its southwest headland, we discovered an island with a shoal on its eastern side, and which lies in 7 and one-half degrees, so that we had to deviate to the west for about fifteen leguas. Then we sailed southwest coasting along the island of Borney to a city of the same name. You must needs know that the land must be approached closely, for there are many shoals outside, and one must keep the sounding line in constant use, for it is a harsh coast. Borney is a large city with a very large bay. Both inside and outside of it are many shoals, so that a native pilot of that place is necessary. We remained there for a considerable number of days, and commenced to trade there and made firm friendship. But later, many canoes, in number 260, were equipped to capture us and came upon us. When we saw them, we left hurriedly, and sailed out of the bay, whereupon we saw some junks coming. We went to them and captured one, in which was a son of the king of Luzon. The latter is a very large island. The captain afterward let him go [<hi>i.e.</hi>, the prince of Luz&#243;n] without asking advice of anyone. Borney it a large island which yields cinnamon, mirabolans, and camphor, <pb id="pb353" n="353"/>the last named of which is much esteemed in these lands, and it is said that when people die they are embalmed with it. Borney (that is, the port of Borney) lies in a latitude of 5 degrees and 25 minutes, and a longitude of 201 degrees and 5 minutes from the line of demarcation.&#8221;

 </p><p>The &#8220;Roteiro&#8221; (Stanley, pp. 17&#8211;20) says that while on the way to Borneo, the ships anchor at islands which they call the islets of St. Paul (now, the Mantanani Islands&#8212;Guillemard, <hi>Magellan</hi>, p. 269) at a distance of two and one-half or three leagues from Borneo. Proceeding past a lofty mountain (Kina Balu&#8212;Guillemard) in Borneo, they coast that island to the port of Borneo. Anchoring in that port, the Moro pilots captured at Palawan are sent ashore with one of the crew, and on reaching the city of Borneo, they are taken before the Shahbender of Borneo. The two ships draw in closer to the city and establish trade with the natives. Gonzalo Gomez Espinosa is chosen ambassador to the king to whom he takes a present. After a stay of twenty-three days in Borneo, the men in the ships fearing treachery from the evolutions of a number of praus and junks, attack and capture one of the latter with twenty-seven men. Next morning the junk commanded by the son of the king of Luzon and ninety men, are captured. Of the seven men ashore the king sends two to the ships, but retains the others, whereupon the ships leave, taking with them fourteen men and three women of those captured in the junks. While sailing back over their downward course, the &#8220;Trinidad&#8221; grounds on a point of the island of Borneo, where it remains for four hours until swung clear by the tide.

 </p><p>Brito in his account (Navarrete, iv, pp. 309, 310) says that the Borneans fear at first lest the strangers be Portuguese and that their object is conquest, but finally being reassured by Espinosa who takes a present to the king, pilots are promised as far as Mindanao. During their stay of a month at Borneo, two Greeks desert the ships. Three others, among them Carvalho&#8217;s son, are ashore when the fear of attack instigated by the two Greeks leads the two ships to attack the Borneans, and the five men are left behind on the island.

Notwithstanding the fact that Stanley was a convert to Islamism and a student of that <pb id="pb355" n="355"/>faith, some of these practices may have been introduced into Borneo, as the rites there being far from their center, may have become vitiated or imperfectly learned in the first place.

The Malay camphor tree (<hi>dipterocarpus</hi> or <hi>Dryabalanops camphora</hi>) is confined, so far as known, to a few parts of the islands of Sumatra and Borneo, where it is very abundant. The oil (both fluid and solid) is found in the body of the tree where the sap should be, but not in all trees. The Malay name for camphor is a slight corruption of the Sanskrit one &#8220;karpura,&#8221; and to distinguish it from the camphor of China and Japan, the word Barus is annexed (the name of the seaport of the western coast of Sumatra, whence camphor was chiefly exported from that island).

The Sultan of Jol&#243; claims the fisheries as his own and rents them out, but always has trouble with the lessees, and his ownership is disputed by the datos.

The first conjecture is probably correct if we take Albo&#8217;s word that the two ships turned to the southeast after passing the island Sibuco; and the fact that the <pb id="pb358" n="358"/>main west coast east of Zamboanga is remarkably free of islands, lends color to the second.

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n458" target="r458">458</ref></hi> Of these islands (some of them in the Talantse group) Cheama is Kima; Carachita is Karakitang; Para still retains that name, or is called Pala; Zanghalura is Sangalong or Sangaluan; Ciau is Siao or Sian; Paghinzara (so called by Albo, <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut supra</hi>) figures on Valentyn&#8217;s map (<hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut supra</hi>, note 457) as Pangasare, though the same island seems also to be called Tagulanda, so that Guillemard is right in his identification of this island; it is identified with the island of Roang by the British Admiralty map of 1890, while Mosto conjectures that it may be the island of Biaro.

 </p><p>Albo&#8217;s narrative (Navarrete, iv, pp. 222&#8211;224) of the events of the two ships from the time they leave Borneo to the arrival at the Moluccas is as follows: &#8220;We left Borney, and returned by the road whence we had come, and consequently took the channel between the headland of the island of Borney and Poluan. Turning west [<hi>sic</hi>] we went toward the island of Quagayan, and thus we went by that same route in search of the island of Quipit toward the south. On this course between Quipit and Cagayan, we saw to the southward an island called Solo, where many very large pearls are to be found. The king of that island is said to have a pearl as large as an egg. That island lies in a latitude of 6 degrees. While on that course, we came across three small islets and farther on we met an island called Tagima, where many pearls are said to be found. The latter island lies northeast by east and southwest by west with Solo. Tagima lies in a latitude of 6 and five-sixths degrees, and is located opposite the headland of Quipit. Many islets lie between those two islands, and one must take to the open as he approaches Quipit. The abovenamed headland lies in 7 and one-fourth degrees, and extends southeast and west northwest with Poluan.

 </p><p>&#8220;Thence we coasted the island of Quipit going toward the south. Turning east by south we sailed toward certain rocky islets. Along the coast many settlements are passed, where considerable excellent cinnamon grows, and for which we traded. That coast also produces a quantity of ginger. Then we sailed northeast until we saw a gulf, whereupon we turned southeast until we saw a large island. There is a very large settlement extending from that point to the eastern headland of the island of Quipit, and at the headland of the said island. Considerable gold is obtained there from a very large river. That headland lies 91 and one-half degrees from the meridian.

 </p><p>&#8220;We left Quipit for Maluco and turned southeast, where we saw an island called Sibuco. Then we turned south southeast, where we saw another island called Viramo Batolaque, continuing along that same course to the head of that island. Then we saw another island called Candicar, and sailed eastward between <pb id="pb360" n="360"/>the two islands until we reached a point some distance ahead, and at that place we entered a channel between Candicar and another island called Sarangani. We anchored at the latter island and took a pilot for Maluco. Those two islands lie in 4 and two-thirds degrees, while the headland of Quipit lies in 7 and one-fourth degrees, the headland of Sibuco in 6 degrees south latitude, and the headland of Virano Batolaque in 5 degrees. From the headland of Quipit and Candicar, the course is north northwest and south southeast without meeting any headland.

 </p><p>&#8220;We left Sarangani and sailed south by east until we reached the right side of an island called Sanguin. Between the two islands lie a number of islets lying toward the west. Sanguin lies in 3 and two-thirds degrees.

 </p><p>&#8220;From Sanguin we sailed south by east to an island called Sian. Between those islands lie many rocky islets. The latter island lies in exactly 3 degrees.

 </p><p>&#8220;We sailed south by west to an island called Paginsara, which lies in 10 and one-sixth degrees. The course from that island to Sarangani is north by east and south by west and all those islands are sighted.

 </p><p>&#8220;From Paginsara we sailed south by east until we reached a position midway between two islets which lie northeast and southwest from one another. The one to the northeast is called Suar and the other Mean. The first lies in 1 degree 45 minutes and the other in 1 and one-half degrees.

 </p><p>&#8220;We sailed south southeast from Mean, until we sighted the islands of the Malucos. Then we turned east and entered a channel between Mare and Tidori, where we anchored. We were received there with the utmost friendliness and established a firm peace. We built a house ashore in order to trade with those people, and abode there many days until the ships were laden.&#8221;

 </p><p>The &#8220;Roteiro&#8221; (Stanley, pp. 20&#8211;23) says that after leaving Borneo, a small junk laden with cocoanuts was overhauled and captured, and that shortly after the ships were careened for repairs in the port of St. Mary of August (see <hi>ante</hi>, note 435). Steering southwest on again setting sail, they come to the island of Fagajam (Cagayan) and that of Seloque (Solo or Jol&#243;), where they learn that pearls are abundant. Next they reach Quipe (Quipit), running between it and the island of Tamgym (Tagima). &#8220;And always running along the coast of the said island, and going thus, they fell in with a parao laden with sago in loaves, which is bread made of a tree which is named cajare, which the people of that country eat as bread. This parao carried twenty-one men, and the chief of them had been in Maluco in the house of Francisco Serram, and having gone further along this island they arrived in sight of some islands <pb id="pb361" n="361"/>which are named Semrryn.&#8221; A guide to Maluco is bargained for, but after arrangements are concluded he attempts to play false, whereupon he and some others are captured. The natives attempt pursuit but are unable to overtake the two ships. Next day sighting an island, and a calm coming upon them, while the currents drew the vessels in toward shore, the old pilot escapes. Continuing they sight &#8220;three high mountains belonging to a nation of people whom they call the Salabos [Celebes?],&#8221; and shortly after desiring to take water at a small island, they are deterred by one of their native pilots, who assures them that the people are hostile. &#8220;While still in this neighborhood, they saw the islands themselves of Maluco, and for rejoicing they fired all the artillery, and they arrived at the island on the 8th of November of 1521, so that they spent from Seville to Maluco two years, two months and twenty-eight days, for they sailed on the 10th of August of 1519.&#8221;

 </p><p>The anonymous Portuguese (Stanley, p. 31) places the distance from the Ladrones to the Moluccas at 1,000 miles, the archipelago of St. Lazarus &#8220;where there occur many islands&#8221; intervening.

 </p><p>At this point in the Italian MS. are found two charts, as follows: 1.

It has been applied as a collective name to all the islands of their district, but it is correct of only the five mentioned by Pigafetta (for whose ancient names, see <hi rend="sc">Vol. XVI</hi>, p. 221). Varthema (<hi>Travels</hi>, Hakluyt Society edition, pp. 245, 246), gives a slight account of the district under the name of the &#8220;island of Monoch, where the cloves grow,&#8221; which Magalh&#227;es showed to C&#225;rlos I (Guillemard&#8217;s <hi>Magellan</hi>, p. 102). Barbosa gives the first authentic account of the five Moluccas (which he names) in his <hi>East African and Malabar Coasts</hi> (Hakluyt Society edition), pp. 201, 202, 219, 220. See also Crawfurd&#8217;s <hi>Dictionary</hi>, pp. 283&#8211;285.

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n476" target="r476">476</ref></hi> Francisco Serr&#227;o, brother of Jo&#227;o Serr&#227;o, was Magalh&#227;es&#8217;s most intimate friend, and they had been close companions in the stirring years of early Portuguese operations in far eastern waters. In 1509, Serr&#227;o sailed on the fleet sent by Almeida to reconnoiter Malacca. Having been sent ashore with a large force, he was attacked by the Malays and only the prompt assistance headed by Magalh&#227;es saved him. In January, 1510, while returning from the expedition, he suffered shipwreck. In 1511 he was sent as captain of one of three ships under Antonio d&#8217; Abreu to the Moluccas for purposes of exploration and trade, but the expedition failed to reach the islands, going only as far as the islands of Banda. On this expedition, Serr&#227;o&#8217;s ship was abandoned as unseaworthy, and the junk bought in its stead was wrecked on an island. Here pirates landing, Serr&#227;o and his men took possession of their boats and thus reached Amboina in safety. The opportunity offering, Serr&#227;o went to Ternate, where he espoused the cause of that king against the king of Tidore, by the latter of whom he was finally poisoned about the time of Magalh&#227;es&#8217;s death. A number of letters passed between Magalh&#227;es and Serr&#227;o, during the years spent by the latter in Ternate, and Magalh&#227;es made use of them to persuade C&#225;rlos I to undertake the expedition. See Guillemard&#8217;s <hi>Magellan</hi>.

The testoon (tost&#227;o, tost&#245;es) is a Portuguese silver coin. It was first struck in the fifteenth century (Hazlitt&#8217;s <hi>Coinage of European Continent</hi>).

 </p><p><hi rend="sup"><ref id="n478" target="r478">478</ref></hi> It is impossible to be sure of the correct form of these names. MS. 5,650 gives them as follows: &#8220;Checchily Momoly, Tadore Vimghi, Checchily de Roix, Cili Manzur, Cilli Paggi, Chialin, Checchilin Catara, Vaiechuserich, and Colano Ghappi.&#8221; Amoretti (followed by Stanley) makes these names &#8220;Chechili-Momuli, Jadore Vunghi, Chechilideroix, Cilimanzur, Cilipagi, <pb id="pb365" n="365"/>Chialinchechilin, Cataravajecu, Serich, and Calanopagi.&#8221; Mosto gives the names as in the present edition with the exception of the sixth and seventh which he gives as &#8220;Chialin Chechilin&#8221; and &#8220;Cathara.&#8221; <hi>Checheli</hi> (<hi>Chechelin</hi>) and possibly <hi>Cili</hi>, denotes the title <hi>Cachil</hi> (&#8220;noble&#8221;).

The &#8220;Roteiro&#8221; (Stanley, pp. 23, 24), says that this man was found in the island of Targatell (Ternate) and that letters were sent him, asking him &#8220;to come and speak with them, to which he replied that he did not dare, because the king of the country forbade it.&#8221; However, permission is secured from the king and Lorosa comes to the ships. An extract from a letter from the Indies (<hi rend="sc">Vol. I</hi>, p. 299) says that Lorosa was taken prisoner. Brito (Navarrete, iv, p. 305) merely mentions the fact that he had left with the Spaniards. He remained with the &#8220;Trinidad,&#8221; and was promptly executed by the Portuguese when he fell into their hands (see Guillemard&#8217;s <hi>Magellan</hi>, p. 303).
