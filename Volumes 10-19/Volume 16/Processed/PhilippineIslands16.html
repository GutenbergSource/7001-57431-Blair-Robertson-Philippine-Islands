<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>In the present volume is concluded the notable work by Morga, <i>Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas</i>, which was begun in <span class="smallcaps">Vol</span>. XV. The reader is referred to the preface of that volume for some account of the book, and of the manner in which it is
presented in this series. Another book notable in the history of the Philippines is that of Argensola, <i>Conqvista de las Islas Molvcas</i> (Madrid, 1609). In presenting here this work, the Editors follow the plan which proves to be more or less necessary with
many of the printed early histories of the islands&#8212;that of translating in full only such parts of the book as relate directly
to the Philippines, and are of especial value or importance; and furnishing a brief synopsis of all matter omitted, in order
that the reader may survey the book as a whole, and understand the relations and connections of the parts that are presented
in full with those that are synopsized. This method is rendered necessary by the limitations of this series in regard to space,
especially as most of the old histories&#8212;as Aduarte&#8217;s, San Agustin&#8217;s, and La Concepci&oacute;n&#8217;s&#8212;are exceedingly voluminous; and,
moreover, devote much space to the affairs of Japan, China, and other countries outside the Philippines. All matter of this
sort must of course, be omitted; and much of what <a id="d0e172"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e172">12</a>]</span>remains is more useful for annotations, or is relatively unimportant for publication. The Editors consider, as do many other
persons interested in this series, that it is desirable to present (especially in the early period of the Philippine history)
the larger part of these documents from the manuscript and hitherto unpublished material largely conserved in foreign archives;
and that the needs of students and investigators will thus be better served than by occupying the valuable and limited space
of this series with complete translations of books which can be found in large American libraries. The location of all these
will be noted, so far as is possible, in the volume devoted to bibliographical information at the end of this series; meanwhile
the needs of most readers will be suitably met by the synopses of omitted matter and the free use of such works as those of
La Concepci&oacute;n and San Antonio in annotations. The Editors purpose to present a few of these histories, especially in the earlier
period, in very full form, so far as they cover Philippine history; for these are original sources, from which later writers
obtained much of their material. These methods render this series unusually rich in valuable historical material, all carefully
selected, and much of it greatly condensed by the excision of extraneous, irrelevant, and unimportant matter. The parts thus
omitted and synopsized will be, as heretofore, indicated by enclosing the synopses in brackets.

<hr><p>

</p>
<p>Continuing his narrative, Morga describes his voyage to Mexico, whither he goes (1603) to be a member of the Audiencia there.
He then relates the events of the Chinese uprising in Luz&oacute;n in that year, <a id="d0e178"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e178">13</a>]</span>which has been fully described in previous volumes of this series; and his picturesque although plain narrative casts new
light upon that episode. Many Spaniards in Manila are so alarmed by this danger that they remove, with all their households
and property, to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a; but one of the ships carrying them is lost at sea, and the other is compelled, after great
injury and loss, to return to Manila&#8212;a serious calamity for the colony there. The governor does his best to fortify the city,
and re&euml;nforcements and supplies are provided for him from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. Bishop Benavides dies (1605). Friars from the islands
go to Japan, but the emperor of that country is offended at their preaching, and advises Acu&ntilde;a to restrain them. In the summer
of 1605 arrive supplies and men from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and Acu&ntilde;a proceeds with his preparations for the expedition against the
Dutch in the Moluccas. In the following spring he sets out on this enterprise, conducting it in person; Morga describes this
naval campaign in detail. Ternate is captured by the Spaniards without bombardment, and with little loss to themselves. The
fugitive king of the island is persuaded to surrender to the Spaniards and become a vassal of Felipe. Several other petty
rulers follow his example and promise not to allow the Dutch to engage in the clove trade. Acu&ntilde;a builds a new fort there,
and another in Tidore, leaving Juan de Esquivel as governor of the Moluccas, with a garrison and several vessels far their
defense, and carrying to Manila the king of Ternate and many of his nobles, as hostages. During Acu&ntilde;a&#8217;s absence a mutiny occurs
among the Japanese near Manila, which is quelled mainly by the influence of the friars. <a id="d0e180"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e180">14</a>]</span>The governor dies, apparently from poison, soon after his return to Manila. The trade of the islands is injured by the restrictions
laid upon it by the home government; and the reduction of Ternate has not sufficed to restrain the Moro pirates. The natives
of the Moluccas are uneasy and rebellious, especially as they have a prospect of aid from the Dutch, who are endeavoring to
regain their lost possessions there. Morga cites a letter from a Spanish officer at La Palma, recounting the purpose and outcome
of van Noordt&#8217;s expedition to the Indian archipelago.

</p>
<p>The historical part of Morga&#8217;s account ends here; and the final chapter is devoted to a description of the islands and their
people, the customs and religious beliefs of the natives, and the condition at that time of the Spanish colony and the city
of Manila. He describes the principal islands of the Philippine group, beginning with Luz&oacute;n; the various races of inhabitants&#8212;Moros,
Negritos, and Visayans: their mode of dress, their occupations and industries, their habits of life; their weapons, their
ships and boats; the trees and fruits of the islands; the animals and birds, both wild and tame; the reptiles, fishes, and
other creatures; and various plants. Among these is the buyo (or betel); the habit of chewing it has become universal among
the Spaniards, of all classes, and poison is often administered through its medium. Various means and methods of poisoning
are described, as well as some antidotes therefor. Some account is given of the gold mines and pearl fisheries, and of other
products of the country which form articles of commerce. Morga describes the two great lakes of Luz&oacute;n (Bombon and Bai), Manila
and its harbor and approaches, and other principal ports, <a id="d0e184"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e184">15</a>]</span>with some neighboring islands; and gives some account of the Visayan people and the larger islands inhabited by them, and
of the tides in the archipelago. Then follows an interesting and detailed account of the Filipino peoples, their language,
customs, beliefs, etc. The language used in Luz&oacute;n and other northern islands is different from that of the Visayas; but all
the natives write, expressing themselves fluently and correctly, and using a simple alphabet which resembles the Arabic. Their
houses, and their mode of life therein, arc fully described; also their government, social organization, and administration
of justice. The classes and status of slaves, and the causes of enslavement are recounted. Their customs in marriages and
dowries, divorces, adoption, and inheritance are described; also in usury, trading, and punishment for crimes. The standard
of social purity is described by Morga as being very low; yet infamous vices were not indigenous with them, but communicated
by foreigners, especially by the Chinese. The natives of Luz&oacute;n appear to be superior, both intellectually and morally, to
the Visayan peoples. Their religious beliefs and practices are recounted by Morga, who naturally ascribes these to the influence
of the devil. He also narrates the entrance of Mahometanism into the islands, and how it was checked by the coming of the
Spaniards.

</p>
<p>Morga next sketches the condition at that time of Spanish colonies in the islands. He describes the city of Manila in detail,
with its fortifications, arsenals, government and municipal buildings, cathedral, and convents; also the seminary of Santa
Potenciana, and the hospitals. There are six hundred houses, <a id="d0e188"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e188">16</a>]</span>mostly built of stone, within the walls, and even more in the suburbs; &#8220;and all are the habitations and homes of Spaniards.&#8221;
All the people, both men and women, are clad and gorgeously adorned in silks; and nowhere is there greater abundance of food,
and of other necessaries of human life, than in Manila. Morga enumerates the dignitaries, ecclesiastical and civil, who reside
in the city; and mentions it as the center and metropolis of the archipelago. He then briefly describes the other Spanish
settlements in the Philippines; and mentions in their turn the various orders and their work there, with the number of laborers
in each. He praises their efforts for the conversion, education, and social improvement of the Indians. He defines the functions
of both the civil and the ecclesiastical authorities, and the policy of the government toward the natives; and describes the
application and results in the Philippines of the encomienda system imported thither from America. He deprecates the permission
given to the Indians for paying their tributes in kind or in money, at their option; for it has led to their neglecting their
former industries, and thus to the general damage of the country. Slavery still exists among them, but the Spaniards have
been forbidden to enslave the natives. Personal services of various sorts are due from the latter, however, to their encomenderos,
to the religious, and to the king, for all of which they receive a moderate wage; and all other services for the Spaniards
are voluntary and paid. Close restrictions are laid upon the intercourse of the Spaniards with natives. Various information
is given regarding appointments to office, residencias, elections, town government, and finances; also of the <a id="d0e190"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e190">17</a>]</span>ecclesiastical organization, expenses, and administration, as well as of the incomes of the religious orders. Morga recounts
the numbers, character, pay, and organization of the military and naval forces in the islands. The bulk of the citizens are
merchants and traders, commerce being the chief occupation and support of the Spanish colony. Manila is a market for all the
countries of Eastern Asia, from Japan to Borneo. The China trade is restricted to the inhabitants of the Philippines; Morga
describes its nature and extent, and the manner in which it is conducted, as well as the character and methods of the Chinese
traders. A similar account is given of the trade carried on with the Philippines by the Japanese, Borneans, and other neighboring
peoples, and of the shipment to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a of the goods thus procured. This last commerce is &#8220;so great and profitable, and
easy to control, that the Spaniards do not apply themselves to, or engage in, any other industry,&#8221; and thus not only they
neglect to avail themselves of and develop the natural resources of the country, but the natives are neglecting and forgetting
their former industries; and the supply of silver in the country steadily flows out of it and into the hands of infidels.
Morga enumerates the officials, revenues, and expenditures of the colonial government. As its income is too small for its
necessary expenses, the annual deficit is made up from the royal treasury of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. But this great expense is incurred
&#8220;only for the Christianization and conversion of the natives, for the hopes of greater fruits in other kingdoms and provinces
of Asia.&#8221;

</p>
<p>The large extent of the Chinese immigration to the islands is disapproved by Morga, as unsafe to the <a id="d0e194"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e194">18</a>]</span>Spaniards and injurious to the natives. Some Chinese are needed for the service of the Spaniards, for all the trades are carried
on by them; but the number of Chinese allowed to live in the islands should be restricted to those who are thus needed. Morga
describes the character, dress, mode of life, and settlements of the Chinese near Manila; they are cared for in religious
matters by the Dominican friars. The Christian Chinese live apart from the heathens, in a settlement of some five hundred
people; Morga has but a poor opinion of even these converts. Some account is also given of the Japanese who have settled in
Manila; Morga commends them, and states that they prove to be good Christians.

</p>
<p>He ends his work by a detailed account of the navigation and voyage to and from the Philippines. The Mexican port of departure
for this route has been removed from Navidad to Acapulco. Morga describes the westward voyage; the stop at the Ladrone Islands,
and the traffic of the natives with the ships; and the route thence, and among the Philippine Islands. The return route to
Mexico is much more difficult and dangerous; for the winds are varying and not always favorable, and the ship must change
its course more frequently, and go far north to secure favoring winds, there encountering cold weather. These severe changes
cause much suffering, and even death; and the vessel makes this voyage without once touching land until it reaches Acapulco,
a period of five or six months. Morga also describes the voyage to Spain by way of Goa and the Cape of Good Hope, which also
is long and dangerous.
</p>

</p>
<p>Argensola writes a history of &#8220;the conquest of the <a id="d0e202"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e202">19</a>]</span>Malucas,&#8221; and begins by describing the islands thus named, their inhabitants, and the customs, mode of dress, and language
of the people. He relates the current stories of their origin and of their early intercourse with Occidental peoples, mainly
through the spice trade. The earlier expeditions of the Portuguese to the Moluccas arouse the hostility of the natives; and
so much difficulty and expense to the government is thus occasioned that his councilors advise Felipe&nbsp;II to abandon the Philippines
and Moluccas, as not worth so much cost. This he refuses to do, on account of the necessity and duty of converting the pagans
in those lands&#8212;a decision confirmed also by Felipe III. Argensola enumerates the various arguments pro and con regarding the
retention of the islands by Spain, which he justifies for the sake of converting the heathen. The points thus far given are
those of the brief synopsis which results from our examination of books i&#8211;iv in the <i>Conqvista</i>, Turning to book v, we find a brief outline of the conquest of the Philippines by Legazpi, their peoples, their chief products,
and their fauna. The expedition of Pe&ntilde;alosa to conquer Ternate is described; it proves a failure, for various causes. The
king of Spain sends the &#8220;invincible armada&#8221; against England (1588), desiring to check the inroads of Northern heretics against
Spanish commerce in the Orient; but that fleet is defeated, and dispersed. Santiago de Vera also sends an expedition against
Ternate, but it also is a failure. One of the princes that island asks for Spanish aid to gain its royalty for himself&#8212;offering,
in return, to become a vassal of Spain; but his death prevents any further arrangement of this sort. Gomez Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as
undertakes <a id="d0e207"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e207">20</a>]</span>an expedition for the conquest of the Moluccas, of which and of his tragic end a full account is given in book vi, furnishing
much interesting information thereon which is not elsewhere to be obtained. Dasmari&ntilde;as drafts rowers from among the Filipino
natives and the Chinese, by force; this causes much resentment among them. He obtains full reports of affairs in the Moluccas,
and advice regarding the conduct of the campaign, from the Jesuits in those islands. Dasmari&ntilde;as sets out on this expedition
(October 17, 1594), his own galley being manned by Chinese rowers. These, being harshly treated, mutiny, and murder all the
Spaniards on the galley save two (October 25), a friar and the governor&#8217;s secretary. The governor&#8217;s death renders necessary
the appointment of a temporary successor to his office; this is his son, Luis Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as. The murderers return to Luz&oacute;n,
with armed vessels, hoping to find the country defenseless and conquer it; but the forces at Manila are sufficient to overawe
the Chinese.

</p>
<p>At this juncture, Langara, king of Camboja, asks for aid from the Spaniards; and Dasmari&ntilde;as sends for this purpose an expedition
under command of Gallinato. The Spaniards slay the usurper of the Cambojan throne; this dignity is offered to Gallinato, but
he refuses it, and Ruiz and Velloso replace the rightful heir on the throne. Dasmari&ntilde;as himself undertakes another expedition
to Camboja, at his own cost; but he is driven by storms to the Chinese coast, some of his ships are wrecked, and another is
destroyed, with most of its crew, by Malays at Camboja. These disasters put an end, for the time, to any further attempts
against Ternate.

</p>
<p>Argensola relates the exploits of Figueroa and his <a id="d0e213"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e213">21</a>]</span>successors in subduing the Mindanaos, who are aided by the king of Ternate, as being in a sense his vassals. Felipe&nbsp;II dies
(1598), and for a time the affairs of Moluccas are neglected. Book vii mainly relates to Dutch voyages to the Eastern Archipelago;
the presence of the Dutch encourages the Ternatans to keep up their resistance to the Spaniards and Portuguese. Governor Acu&ntilde;a
arrives in the Philippines (May, 1602), and for some time is occupied with the internal affairs of the colony and the establishment
of amicable relations with the Japanese. These matters being settled, he turns his mind toward the conquest of the Moluccas;
and he co&ouml;perates with the expedition under Furtado de Mendoza, which had been sent for this purpose from India. The combined
fleets meet with temporary successes at Ternate, but are finally compelled to abandon the undertaking. The home government
finally decides that it must be again and effectively prosecuted; and that Acu&ntilde;a himself shall conduct another expedition
against the Moluccas. The royal decree for this (dated June 20 1604) is given in full.

</p>
<p>Argensola relates the great fire in Manila and the Chinese insurrection, both in 1603; he gives some information thereon which
is not found in other accounts. This revolt, although quelled, causes great disturbance of business and industry, and much
want and distress, in Manila, which had so largely been dependent upon its Chinese population. Soon afterward re&euml;nforcements
and supplies are received there from Mexico. In February, 1605, a Dutch fleet appears in the Eastern archipelago, and captures
Amboina and Tidore. Portuguese fugitives from Tidore inform Acu&ntilde;a of the purpose of the Dutch to <a id="d0e217"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e217">22</a>]</span>attack the galleons on the Mexican route and perhaps other Spanish interests; and to drive out the Spaniards from that quarter
of the world. He immediately sends more men to the garrisons in the Pintados, and takes other precautions. The arrival of
numerous re&euml;nforcements at Manila encourages him and checks the insolence of surrounding peoples. The Dutch aid the Ternatans,
while Acu&ntilde;a makes vigorous preparations for the expedition to be made against these foes. He sails with over three thousand
men, in thirty-six vessels, from Iloilo on January 5, 1606. The flagship is wrecked at La Caldera; the other vessels mistake
their course, and do not reach the Moluccas until late in March. They besiege Ternate, and finally carry it by assault; the
city and fort are pillaged by the soldiers. Afterward the king is induced to surrender and Acu&ntilde;a makes a treaty with him.
The king surrenders his forts and restores all captives; delivers up any Dutchmen or Spanish renegades who may be in Ternate;
and gives up the villages of Christian natives in adjacent islands. Acu&ntilde;a leaves a strong garrison in Ternate, and carries
the king and other captives to Manila. A few weeks after his return, Acu&ntilde;a dies&#8212;by poison, according to popular rumor.

<p>To this volume is appended (apropos of an allusion by Morga) an interesting account of the ancient customs observed by the
natives of Pampanga in the administration of justice. These differed, according to the social status of the parties concerned,
and the kind of crime; but, in general, certain fixed amounts were paid as the penalties for most crimes, and in some cases
the penalty was life for life. If the culprit could not pay the fine, he was usually sold <a id="d0e221"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e221">23</a>]</span>as a slave. Parricide and infanticide were apparently unknown among them. Marriages, divorces, inheritances, enslavements,
disputes, etc., are all considered in this account, obtained by the Franciscan Juan de Plasencia from the natives.

</p>
<p>On the tenth [of July]<a id="d0e270src" href="#d0e270" class="noteref">2</a> of the same year, the vessels &#8220;Espiritu-Santo&#8221; and &#8220;Jesus Maria&#8221; left the port of Cabit en route for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a&#8212;in the
wake of two smaller vessels, which had been despatched a fortnight before&#8212;with the Filipinas merchandise. Don Lope de Ulloa
was their commander, while Doctor Antonio de Morga left those islands in the almiranta, the &#8220;Santo Espiritu,&#8221; to fill the
office of alcalde of the court of Mexico. Before leaving the bay, both vessels were struck head on by a storm, and went dragging
upon the coast, buffeted by the heavy seas and winds, and amid dark and tempestuous weather, from three in the afternoon until
morning <a id="d0e276"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e276">28</a>]</span>of the next day, notwithstanding that they were anchored with two heavy cables in the shelter of the land, and their topmasts
struck. Then they grounded upon the coast, in La Pampanga, ten leguas from Manila. The storm lasted for three more consecutive
days. Consequently it was regarded as impossible for those vessels to sail and make their voyage, inasmuch as the season was
now well advanced, and the vessels were very large and heavily laden, and were deeply imbedded in the sand. Advice was immediately
sent overland to Manila, whence were brought several Chinese ships, cables, and anchors. By dint of the great efforts exerted,
both vessels, each singly, were fitted with tackle and cables, which were rigged at the stern. There awaiting the high tide,
the ships were drawn, by force of capstan and men, stern first for more than one legua through a bank of sand, upon which
they had struck, until they were set afloat, on the twenty-second of July, St. Magdelen&#8217;s day. Immediately they set sail again,
as the vessels had sustained no injury, nor sprung any leak; and they made their voyage and navigation, under light winds,
to the coast of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. A violent south-southwest gale, accompanied by heavy showers, hail, and cold, struck the ship
&#8220;Espiritu Sancto&#8221; on the tenth of November, in forty-two degrees, and within sight of land. The wind was blowing obliquely
toward the shore, upon which the vessel was almost wrecked several times. The vessel suffered distress and lost its rigging,
while the crew was worn out by the voyage and with the cold. The storm lasted until November twenty-second. On the morning
of that day, while the ship was in the trough of the waves, and with topmasts shipped, it was struck by a squall of rain and
<a id="d0e278"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e278">29</a>]</span>hail, accompanied by great darkness. A thunderbolt, descending the mainmast, struck the vessel amidships. It killed three
men besides wounding and maiming eight others; it had entered the hatches, and torn open the mainhatch, with a blaze of light,
so that the interior of the ship could be seen. Another thunderbolt fell down along the same mast among the entire crew, and
stunned sixteen persons, some of whom were speechless and unconscious all that day. It left the vessel by the pump-dale. The
next day, the wind veered to north-northeast, whereupon the ship set sail, and went coasting along the land, with sufficient
winds until the nineteenth of the month of December, when it made port at Acapulco. There were found the two smaller vessels
that had sailed first from Manila. Three days later, General Don Lope de Ulloa entered the same port of Acapulco, in the ship
&#8220;Jesus Maria.&#8221; That vessel had sustained the same storms as the ship &#8220;Espiritu Sancto.&#8221; From the time when the two vessels
had separated, on sailing out of the channel of Capul, in the Filipinas Islands, they had not sighted one another again during
the entire voyage.

</p>
<p>In the same year six hundred and three, Governor Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a sent the ship &#8220;Sanctiago&#8221; from Manila to Japon, with merchandise.
It was ordered to make its voyage to Quanto, in order to comply with the desire and wish of Daifusama. As news had been already
received of the death of Fray Geronimo de Jesus, four of the most important religious of his order in Manila&#8212;namely, Fray
Diego de Bermeo <a id="d0e282src" href="#d0e282" class="noteref">3</a> <a id="d0e290"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e290">40</a>]</span>(who had been provincial), Fray Alonso de la Madre de Dios, Fray Luys Sotello,<a id="d0e292src" href="#d0e292" class="noteref">4</a> and one other associate&#8212;sailed on that vessel for the said kingdom.

</p>
<p>As soon as the ships &#8220;Jesus Maria&#8221; and &#8220;Espiritu Sancto&#8221; sailed for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and the ship &#8220;Sanctiago&#8221; with the religious
for Japon, there was more time to discuss further the matter started by the coming of the Chinese mandarins. For finding themselves
unoccupied with other matters, fear of the Sangleys became universal, and the suspicions that were current that the Sangleys
were about to commit some mischievous outbreak. This the archbishop and some religious affirmed and told, publicly and privately.
At this time, a considerable number of Chinese were living in Manila and its environs. Some of them were baptized Christians
living in the settlements of Baibai and Minondoc,<a id="d0e300src" href="#d0e300" class="noteref">5</a> on the other <a id="d0e306"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e306">31</a>]</span>side of the river, opposite the city. Most of them were infidels, occupied and living in these same settlements and in the
shops of the pari&aacute;n in the city; [they were employed] as merchants and in all other occupations. The majority of them were
fishermen, stonecutters, charcoal-burners, porters, masons, and day-laborers. Greater security was always felt in regard to
the merchants, for they are the better class of people, and those who are most interested, because of their property. So great
security was not felt about the others, even though they were Christians; because, as they are a poor and covetous people,
they would be inclined to any act of meanness. However, it was always thought that it would be difficult for them to cause
any commotion, unless a strong fleet came from China, on which they could rely. Talk continued to increase daily, and with
it suspicion; for some of the Chinese themselves, both infidels and Christians, in order to prove themselves friends of the
Spaniards, and clean from all guilt, even told the Spaniards that there was to be an insurrection shortly, and other similar
things. Although the governor always considered these statements as fictions and the exaggerations of that nation, and did
not credit them, yet he was not so heedless that he did not act cautiously and watch, although with dissembling, for whatever
might happen. He took pains to have the city guarded and the soldiers armed, besides flattering the most prominent of the
Chinese and the merchants, whom he assured of their lives and property. The natives of La Pampanga and other provinces near
by were instructed beforehand to supply the city with rice and other provisions, and to come to re&euml;nforce it with <a id="d0e308"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e308">32</a>]</span>their persons and arms, should necessity arise. The same was done with some Japanese in the city. As all this was done with
some publicity, since it could not be done secretly, as so many were concerned, one and all became convinced of the certainty
of the danger. Many even desired it, in order to see the peace disturbed, and to have the opportunity to seize something.<a id="d0e310src" href="#d0e310" class="noteref">6</a> From that time, both in the city and its environs, where the Sangleys were living scattered, these people began to persecute
the Sangleys by word and deed. The natives, Japanese and soldiers of the camp took from them their possessions and inflicted
on them other ill-treatment, calling them dogs and traitors, and saying that they knew well that they meant to rebel. But
they said they would kill all the Sangleys first, and that very soon, for the governor was preparing for it. This alone was
sufficient to make it necessary for the Sangleys to do what they had no intention of doing.<a id="d0e316src" href="#d0e316" class="noteref">7</a> Some of the most clever and covetous set themselves to rouse the courage of the others, and to make themselves leaders, telling
the Sangleys that their destruction was sure, according to the determination which they saw in the Spaniards, unless they
should anticipate the latter, since they [the Sangleys] were so numerous, and attack and capture the city. They said that
it would not be difficult for them to kill the Spaniards, seize their <a id="d0e322"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e322">33</a>]</span>possessions, and become masters of the country, with the aid and re&euml;nforcements that would immediately come to them from China,
as soon as the auspicious beginning that they would have made in the matter should be known. In order to do this when the
time came, it was advisable to build a fort and quarters in some retired and strong place near the city, where the people
could gather and unite, and where arms and supplies could be provided for the war. At least such a fort would be sufficient
to assure there their lives from the outrages that they were expecting from the Spaniards. It was learned that the chief mover
in this matter was a Christian Sangley, an old-time resident in the country, named Joan Bautista de Vera.<a id="d0e324src" href="#d0e324" class="noteref">8</a> He was rich and highly esteemed by the Spaniards, and feared and respected by the Sangleys. He had often been governor of
the latter, and had many godchildren and dependents. He had become an excellent Spaniard, and was courageous. He himself,
exercising duplicity and cunning, did not leave the city, or the houses of the Spanish during this time, in order to arouse
less suspicion of himself. From there he managed the affair through his confidants; and in order to assure himself better
of the result, and to ascertain the number of men of his race, and to make a census and list of them, he cunningly had each
of them ordered to bring him a needle, which he pretended to be necessary for a certain work that he had to do. These needles
he placed, as he received them, in a little box; and when he took them out of it, he found that he had sufficient men for
his purpose. They began to construct the fort or quarters immediately <a id="d0e330"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e330">34</a>]</span>at a distance of slightly more than one-half legua from the village of Tondo, among some estuaries and swamps, and in a hidden
location.<a id="d0e332src" href="#d0e332" class="noteref">9</a> They stored there some rice and other provisions, and weapons of little importance. The Sangleys began to gather there, especially
the masses&#8212;the common people and day-laborers; for those of the pari&aacute;n, and the mechanics, although urged to do the same,
did not resolve to do it, and remained quiet, guarding their houses and property. The restlessness of the Sangleys daily continued
to become more inflamed. This, and the advices given to the governor and the Spaniards, kept the latter more anxious and apprehensive,
and made them talk more openly of the matter. The Sangleys, seeing that their intention was discovered, and that delay might
be of so great harm to them, determined, although the insurrection was planned for St. Andrew&#8217;s day, the last of November,
to anticipate that day, and to lose no more time. On Friday, the third day of the month of October, the eve of St. Francis,
they collected very hurriedly in the above-mentioned fort; consequently, by nightfall, there were two thousand men in it.
Joan Bautista de Vera&#8212;a thief in the r&ocirc;le of an honest man, since he was the leader and organizer of the treason&#8212;went immediately
to the city and told the governor that the Sangleys had risen, and that they were collecting on the other side of the river.
The governor, suspecting the mischief, had him immediately arrested and carefully guarded; and he was afterward <a id="d0e337"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e337">35</a>]</span>executed. Then, without tap of drum, the governor ordered the companies, both of the camp and the city, to be notified, and
all to hold their arms in readiness. Very shortly after nightfall, Don Luys Dasmari&ntilde;as, who was living near the monastery
and church of Minondoc, on the other side of the river, came hurriedly to the city to advise the governor that the Sangleys
had revolted. He asked for twenty soldiers to go to the other side [of the river], where he would guard the said monastery.
Cristoval de Axqueta, sargento-mayor of the camp, went with these men, together with Don Luys. As the silence of night deepened,
the noise made by the Sangleys grew louder, for they were continuing to assemble and were sounding horns and other instruments,
after their fashion. Don Luys remained to guard the monastery, with the men brought from Manila, where he had placed in shelter
many women and children of Christian Sangleys, with the religious. The sargento-mayor returned immediately to the city, where
he told of what was being done. The call to arms was sounded, for the noise and shouts of the Sangleys, who had sallied out
to set fire to some houses in the country, was so great that it was thought that they were devastating that district. The
Sangleys burned, first, a stone country-house belonging to Captain Estevan de Marquina. The latter was living there with his
wife and children; and none of them escaped, except a little girl, who was wounded, but who was hidden in a thicket.<a id="d0e339src" href="#d0e339" class="noteref">10</a> Thence the Sangleys <a id="d0e349"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e349">36</a>]</span>went to the settlement of Laguio,<a id="d0e351src" href="#d0e351" class="noteref">11</a> situated on the shore of the river, and burned it. They killed several Indians of that settlement, and the rest fled to the
city. There the gates were already shut and all the people, with arms in hand, manned the walls and other suitable posts,
ready for any emergency, until dawn. The enemy, who now had a greater number of men, retired to their fort, to make another
sally thence with more force. Don Luys Dasmari&ntilde;as, who was guarding the church and monastery of Minondoc, expected hourly
that the enemy was about to attack him, and sent a messenger to the governor to beg for more men. These were sent him, and
consisted of regulars and inhabitants of the city, under Captains Don Tomas Brabo de Acu&ntilde;a (the governor&#8217;s nephew), Joan de
Alcega, Pedro de Arzeo, and Gaspar Perez, by whose counsel and advice Don Luys was to be guided on this occasion. All was
confusion, shouting, and outcry in the city, particularly among the Indians, and the women and children, who were coming thither
for safety. Although, to make certain of the Sangleys of the pari&aacute;n, their merchants had been asked to come into the city,
and bring their property, they did not dare to do so; for they always thought that the enemy would take the city because of
their great force of numbers, and annihilate <a id="d0e363"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e363">37</a>]</span>the Spaniards, and they would all be in danger. Consequently they preferred to remain in their pari&aacute;n, in order to join the
victorious side. Don Luys Dasmari&ntilde;as thought it advisable to go in search of the enemy immediately with the re&euml;nforcements
sent him by the governor, before they should all assemble and present a strong front. He left seventy soldiers in Minondoc,
in charge of Gaspar Perez; while with the rest, about one hundred and forty of the best picked arquebusiers, he went to the
village of Tondo, in order to fortify himself in the church, a stone building. He arrived there at eleven o&#8217;clock in the morning.
The Chinese, in number one thousand five hundred, arrived at the same place at the same time, bent on the same purpose. An
hour&#8217;s skirmish took place between the two sides, as to which one would gain the monastery. Captain Gaspar Perez came up with
the re&euml;nforcement of the men left at Minondoc. The enemy retired to his fort, with a loss of five hundred men. Gaspar Perez
returned to his post, where Pedro de Arzeo was also stationed. Don Luys Dasmari&ntilde;as, exultant over this fortunate engagement,
determined immediately to press forward in pursuit of the enemy with his men, notwithstanding the heat of the sun and without
waiting to rest his followers. He sent Alferez Luys de Ybarren to reconnoiter. The latter brought word that the enemy was
in great force, and near by. Although Juan de Alcega and others requested Don Luys to halt and rest his men, and await the
governor&#8217;s orders as to what was to be done, his desire not to lose the opportunity was so great that, rousing his men with
harsh words, in order to make them follow him, he marched forward until they <a id="d0e365"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e365">38</a>]</span>reached a swamp. After leaving the swamp, they came suddenly into a large clearing, where the enemy was stationed. The latter,
upon seeing the Spaniards, surrounded them in force on all sides, armed with clubs, some with catans, and a few with battle-axes.
Don Luys and his men, not being able to retreat, fought valiantly, and killed a number of Sangleys. But finally, as the latter
were in so great force, they cut all the Spaniards to pieces, only four of whom escaped, badly wounded; and these carried
the news to Manila.<a id="d0e367src" href="#d0e367" class="noteref">12</a> This result was of great importance to the Sangleys, both because so many and the best Spanish soldiers were killed in this
place, and because of the weapons that the Sangleys took from them, and which they needed. With these arms they flattered
themselves that their object was more certain of accomplishment. Next day, October five, the Sangleys sent the heads of Don
Luys, Don Tomas, Joan de Alcega, and other captains to the pari&aacute;n; and they told the Sangleys there that, since the flower
of Manila had been killed, they should revolt and join them, or they would immediately come to kill them. The confusion and
grief of the Spaniards in the city was so great that it prevented them from taking the precautions and exercising the diligence
demanded by the affair. But the sight of their necessity, and the spirit of their governor and officials made them all remain
at their posts on the walls, arms in hand. They fortified as strongly as possible the gates of the pari&aacute;n and of Dilao, and
all that part of the wall where the enemy might make an assault. They <a id="d0e373"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e373">39</a>]</span>mounted a piece of artillery above each gate, and stationed there the best men, among whom were religious of all the orders.
Upon that day, Sunday, the enemy, flushed with the victory of the preceding day and their army swelled by the additional men
that joined them, attacked the city. Burning and destroying everything in their path, they went to the river, for there was
no vessel with which to resist them, as all those of the fleet were in the provinces of the Pintados. They entered the pari&aacute;n,<a id="d0e375src" href="#d0e375" class="noteref">13</a> and furiously assaulted the city gate, but were driven back by the arquebuses and muskets, with the loss of many Sangleys.
They went to the church of Dilao, and there assaulted the gate and walls (which were there lower), by means of scaling-ladders,
with the same determination. But they experienced the same resistance and loss, which compelled them, on the approach of night,
to retire with great loss to the pari&aacute;n and to Dilao. That whole night the Spaniards spent in guarding their wall, and in
preparing for the morrow. The enemy passed the night in the pari&aacute;n and at Dilao, making carts, mantelets, <span class="corr" title="Source: scalding-ladders">scaling-ladders</span>, artificial fire, and other contrivances, for approaching and assaulting the wall, and for burning the gates, and setting
fire to everything. At dawn of the next day, Monday, the Sangleys came together with these arms and tools, and having reached
the wall with their bravest and best-armed men, attacked it with great fury and resolution. The artillery destroyed their
machines, and <a id="d0e384"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e384">40</a>]</span>caused them so great injury and resistance with it and the arquebuses, that the Sangleys were forced to retire again to the
pari&aacute;n and to Dilao, with heavy loss. Joan Xuarez Gallinato, accompanied by some soldiers and a Japanese troop, made a sally
from the Dilao gate upon the Sangleys. They reached the church, when the Sangleys turned upon them and threw the Japanese
into disorder. The latter were the cause of all retreating again to seek the protection of the walls, whither the Sangleys
pursued them. At this juncture Captain Don Luys de Velasco entered Manila. He came from the Pintados in a stout caracoa, manned
by some good arquebusiers, while others manned some bancas that sailed in the shelter of the caracoa. They approached the
pari&aacute;n and Dilao by the river, and harassed the enemy quartered there on that and the two following days, so that they were
compelled to abandon those positions. These vessels set fire to the pari&aacute;n, and burned everything, and pursued the enemy wherever
they could penetrate. The Sangleys, upon beholding their cause waning, and their inability to attain the end desired, resolved
to retire from the city, after having lost more than four thousand men; to advise China, so that that country would re&euml;nforce
them; and for their support to divide their men into three divisions in different districts&#8212;one among the Tingues of Passic,
the second among those of Ayonbon, and the third at La Laguna de Bay, San Pablo, and Batangas. On Wednesday they abandoned
the city completely, and, divided as above stated, marched inland. Don Luys de Velasco, with some soldiers and armed Indians
who came from all sides to the relief of Manila, accompanied by some Spaniards who guided them, and the religious from <a id="d0e386"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e386">41</a>]</span>their missions, went by way of the river in pursuit of them, and pressed them, so that they killed and annihilated the bands
bound for the Tingues of Passic and for Ayombon. The majority and main body of the Sangleys went to La Laguna de Bay, the
mountains of San Pablo, and Batangas, where they considered themselves more secure. Burning towns and churches, and everything
in their path, they fortified themselves in the above-mentioned sites. Don Luys de Velasco, with seventy soldiers, continued
to pursue them, killing each day a great number of them. On one occasion Don Luys was so closely engaged with the enemy, that
the latter killed him and ten soldiers of his company, and fortified themselves again in San Pablo and Batangas, where they
hoped to be able to sustain themselves until the arrival of re&euml;nforcements from China.<a id="d0e388src" href="#d0e388" class="noteref">14</a>

</p>
<p>The governor, fearful of this danger, and desirous of finishing the enemy, and giving entire peace to the country, sent Captain
and Sargento-mayor Cristoval de Axqueta Menchaca with soldiers to pursue and finish the enemy. This man left with two hundred
Spaniards&#8212;soldiers and volunteers&#8212;three hundred Japanese, and one thousand five hundred Pampanga and Tag&aacute;l Indians,<a id="d0e396src" href="#d0e396" class="noteref">15</a> on the twentieth of October. He was so expeditious, that with little or no loss of men, he found the Sangleys fortified in
San <a id="d0e402"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e402">42</a>]</span>Pablo and Batangas, and, after fighting with them, killed and destroyed them all. None escaped, except two hundred, who were
taken alive to Manila for the galleys. The captain was occupied in this for twenty days, and with it the war was ended. Very
few merchants were left in Manila, and they had taken the good counsel to betake themselves, with their possessions, among
the Spaniards in the city. At the beginning of the war there were not seven hundred Spaniards in the city capable of bearing
arms.<a id="d0e404src" href="#d0e404" class="noteref">16</a>

</p>
<p>After the end of the war, the need of the city began, for, because of not having Sangleys who worked at the trades, and brought
in all the provisions, there was no food, nor any shoes to wear, not even at excessive prices. The native Indians are very
far from exercising those trades, and have even forgotten <a id="d0e412"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e412">43</a>]</span>much of farming, and the raising of fowls, cattle, and cotton, and the weaving of cloth, which they used to do in the days
of their paganism and for a long time after the conquest of the country.<a id="d0e414src" href="#d0e414" class="noteref">17</a> In addition to this, people thought that Chinese vessels would not come to the islands with food and merchandise, on account
of the late revolution. Above all, they lived not without fear and suspicion that, instead of the merchant vessels, an armed
fleet would attack Manila, in order to avenge the death of their Sangleys. All conspired to sadden the minds of the Spaniards.
After having sent Fray Diego de Guevara, prior of the monastery of St. Augustine in Manila, to the court of Espa&ntilde;a by way
of India, with news of this event&#8212;but who was unable to reach Madrid for three years, because of his various fortunes in India,
Persia, and Italia, through which countries he went&#8212;they immediately sent Captain Marco de la Cueva, together with Fray Luys
Gandullo of the Order of St. Dominic, to the city of <a id="d0e426"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e426">44</a>]</span>Macao in China, where the Portuguese were living, with letters for the chief captain and the council of that city. These letters
advised the latter of the revolt of the Sangleys, and of the result of the war, so that, if they should hear any rumors of
a Chinese fleet, they could send word. At the same time letters were taken from the governor to the Tutons, Aytaos, and visitors
of the provinces of Canton and Chincheo, recounting the outbreak of the Chinese, which obliged the Spaniards to kill them.
Upon their arrival at Macao, Marcos de la Cueva and Fray Luys Gandullo found no news of a fleet, but that everything was quiet&#8212;although
the Chinese had already heard of the insurrection and much of the result, from some Sangleys who had fled from Manila in champans,
upon that occasion. It was immediately learned in Chincheo that these Spaniards were in Macao, whereupon Captains Guansan
Sinu and Guachan, wealthy men and usually engaged in trade with Manila, went to look for them. Having learned the truth of
the event, they took the letters for the mandarins and promised to deliver them. They urged other merchants and vessels of
Chincheo, who were afraid, to go to Manila that year. This was very useful, for through them much of the necessity that the
city [of Manila] was suffering was supplied. With this result and with some powder, saltpeter, and lead which Marcos de la
Cueva had provided for the magazines, the latter left Macao, and sailed to Manila, which he reached in May, to the universal
joy of the city over the news that he brought&#8212;which began to be verified immediately by the coming of the fleet of thirteen
Chinese vessels bearing food and merchandise.

</p>
<p><a id="d0e429"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e429">45</a>]</span>In the month of June of this year six hundred and three,<a id="d0e431src" href="#d0e431" class="noteref">18</a> two vessels were despatched from Manila to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, under command of Don Diego de Mendo&ccedil;a who had been sent that year
by the viceroy, Marques de Montesclaros, with the usual re&euml;nforcements for the islands. The flagship was &#8220;Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de
los Remedios&#8221; and the almiranta &#8220;Sant Antonio.&#8221;

</p>
<p>Many rich men of Manila, warned by the past troubles, took passage in these vessels with their households and property, for
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a&#8212;especially in the almiranta&#8212;with the greatest wealth that has ever left the Filipinas. Both vessels experienced
so severe storms during the voyage, in the altitude of thirty-four degrees, and before having passed Japon, that the flagship,
without masts and greatly lightened and damaged, put back in distress to Manila. The almiranta was swallowed up in the sea,
and no one was saved. This was one of the greatest shipwrecks and calamities that the Filipinas have suffered since the past
ones.

</p>
<p>During the rest of that year and that of six hundred and five, until the sailing of the vessels which were to go to Castilla,<a id="d0e441src" href="#d0e441" class="noteref">19</a> the governor occupied himself in repairing the city, and supplying it with provisions and ammunition, with the special object
and care that the decision which he was awaiting from the court for making an expedition to Maluco&#8212;of which he had been advised
and warned&#8212;should not find him so unprepared as to cause him to delay the expedition. In this he was very successful, for
at that same time, the master-of-camp, Joan de Esquivel, <a id="d0e447"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e447">46</a>]</span>had arrived in Mexico with six hundred soldiers from Espa&ntilde;a. In Mexico more men were being enrolled, and a great preparation
was made of ammunition, food, money, and arms, which the viceroy sent to the governor from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a in March of that year,
by order of his Majesty, in order that he might go to Maluco. All this arrived safely and in due season at Manila.

</p>
<p>Shortly after the ships had left Manila for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and those despatched thence by the viceroy had entered, Archbishop
Don Fray Miguel de Benavides died of a long illness. His body was buried amid the universal devotion and grief of the city.<a id="d0e451src" href="#d0e451" class="noteref">20</a> At this same time, Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a received three letters, by the ships that continued to come from China that year, with
the merchandise and with their principal captains. They were all of the same tenor&#8212;when translated into Castilian&#8212;from the
Tuton and Haytao, and from the inspector-general of the province of Chincheo, and were on the matter of the insurrection of
the Sangleys and their punishment. They were as follows:
</p>
<hr><p>

</p>
<p>[This letter occupies folios 113b&#8211;115a of the original edition of Morga. We have already presented that document in our V0L.
XIII, p. 287, which is translated from a copy of the original manuscript. The answer of Acu&ntilde;a to this letter will be found
in V0L. XIV, in the second document of that volume.]
</p>
<hr><p>

</p>
<p>The letter of the inspector-general was written on the twelfth of the second month&#8212;which according to our reckoning is March
of the twenty-third year <a id="d0e465"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e465">47</a>]</span>of the reign of Vandel [<i>i.e.</i>, Wanleh]. The eunuch&#8217;s <a id="d0e470src" href="#d0e470" class="noteref">21</a> letter was written on the sixteenth of the said month and year; and that of the viceroy, on the twenty-second of the month.

The governor answered these letters through the same messengers, civilly and authoritatively. He gave an explanation of the
deed and justified the Spaniards, and offered friendship and trade anew with the Chinese. He said that their property, which
had remained in Manila, would be restored to the owners, and that those imprisoned in the galleys would be freed in due season.
First, however, he intended to use them for the Maluco expedition, which he was undertaking.

The entrances into various provinces of Japon by the discalced religious of St. Francis and those of St. Dominic and St. Augustine,
continued to be made, both in the Castilian vessel itself which was despatched that year to the kingdoms of Quanto, <a id="d0e479src" href="#d0e479" class="noteref">22</a> and in other Japanese vessels which came to Manila with the silver and flour of the Japanese, in order to trade. This was
permitted and allowed by Daifu, now <a id="d0e494"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e494">48</a>]</span>called Cubosama, who that year sent the governor, through one of his servants, certain weapons and presents, in return for
others which the governor had sent him. He answered the latter&#8217;s letter as follows:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><i>Letter from Daifusama, lord of Japon, to governor Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a, in the year one thousand six hundred and five.</i>


</p>
<p>I received two letters from your Lordship, and all the gifts and presents mentioned in the memorandum. Among them, when I
received them, the wine made from grapes pleased me greatly. During former years, your Lordship requested permission for six
vessels, and last year for four, and I always granted your request. But, what angers me greatly is that among the four vessels
that your Lordship requested was that one called &#8220;Antonio,&#8221; which made the voyage without my orders. This was a very lawless
act, and in contempt of me. Can it be, perhaps, that your Lordship would send to Japon without my permission any vessel that
you wished? Besides this, your Lordship and others have often negotiated about the sects of Japon, and requested many things
in regard to them. This likewise I cannot concede; for this region is called Xincoco [Shinkoku], or &#8220;dedicated to the idols.&#8221;
These have been honored with the highest adoration from the time of our ancestors until now, and their acts I alone cannot
undo or destroy. Consequently, it is not at all advisable that your religion be promulgated or preached in Japon; and if your
Lordship wish to preserve friendship with these kingdoms of Japon and with me, do what I wish, and never do what is displeasing
to me. Lastly, many have told me that many wicked and perverse <a id="d0e503"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e503">49</a>]</span>Japanese, who go to that kingdom and live there for many years, afterward return to Japon. This makes me very angry. Consequently,
your Lordship will, in the future, allow no one of the Japanese to come here in the vessels that come from your country. In
other matters, your Lordship shall act advisedly and prudently, and shall so conduct affairs, that henceforth I may not be
angered on account of them.
</p>

</p>
<p>The governor, carrying out his dearest wish, was to make the expedition to Terrenate in the Malucos, which should be done
quickly, before the enemy could gather more strength than he had then; for he had been informed that the Dutch, who had seized
the island and fortress of Amboino, had done the same with that of Tidore, whence they had driven the Portuguese who had settled
therein, and had entered Terrenate, where they had established a trading-post for the clove-trade. Accordingly, as soon as
the despatches in regard to this undertaking arrived from Espa&ntilde;a, in June of six hundred and five, and the men and supplies
from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, which were brought at the same time by the master-of-camp, Joan de Esquivel, the governor spent the balance
of this year in preparing the ships, men, and provisions that he deemed necessary for the undertaking. Leaving behind in Manila
sufficient force for its defense, he went to the provinces of Pintados, where the fleet was collected, in the beginning of
the year six hundred and six.

</p>
<p>By the fifteenth day of the month of March, the governor had thoroughly prepared the fleet&#8212;which consisted of five ships,
four galleys with poop-lanterns [<i>galeras de fanal</i>], three galliots, four champans, <a id="d0e513"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e513">50</a>]</span>three funeas, two English lanchas, two brigantines, one barca chata<a id="d0e515src" href="#d0e515" class="noteref">23</a> for the artillery, and thirteen fragatas with high freeboard. There were one thousand three hundred Spaniards, counting regulars,
captains and officers, substitutes [<i>entretenidos</i>], and volunteers. Among them were some Portuguese captains and soldiers, under charge of the chief captain of Tidore,<a id="d0e521src" href="#d0e521" class="noteref">24</a> who was at that island when the Dutch seized it. These Portuguese came from Malaca to serve in the expedition. There were
also four hundred Indian pioneers&#8212;Tag&aacute;ls and Pampangos of Manila&#8212;who went to serve at their own cost, under their own officers,
and with their own weapons. There was a quantity of artillery of all kinds, ammunition, tools, and provisions for nine months.<a id="d0e527src" href="#d0e527" class="noteref">25</a> Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a left the point of Hilohilo, which is near the town of Arevalo in the island of Panai, [on the above day]
with all this equipment, and coasting the island of Mindanao, made port at La Caldera, in order to replenish his water, wood,
and other necessaries.

</p>
<p>The governor embarked in the galley &#8220;Santiago&#8221; and took under his charge the other galleys and oared <a id="d0e540"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e540">51</a>]</span>vessels. The ship &#8220;Jesus Maria&#8221; acted as flagship of the other vessels, and was commanded by the master-of-camp, Joan de Esquivel.
Captain and Sargento-mayor Cristoval de Azcueta Menchaca acted as admiral of the fleet, which, after attending to its necessities
at La Caldera, left that port. On setting sail, the flagship, which was a heavy vessel, was unable to leave port, and the
currents drove it shoreward so that, without the others being able to help it, it grounded. It was wrecked there, but the
crew, artillery, and a portion of its ammunition and clothing, were saved. After setting fire to the ship, and taking what
nails and bolts they could, so that the Mindanaos could not make use of them, the fleet continued its voyage. The galleys
coasted along the island of Mindanao, and the ships and other deep-draught vessels sailed in the open sea, all making for
the port of Talangame, in the island of Terrenate. The vessels, although experiencing some changes of weather, first sighted
the islands of Maluco, after they had been reconnoitered by a large Dutch ship, well equipped with artillery, which was anchored
at Terrenate. This vessel fired some heavy artillery at our vessels, and then immediately entered the port, where it fortified
itself under shelter of the land, and with its artillery and crew and the people of Terrenate. The master-of-camp went with
his vessels to the island of Tidore, where he was well received by the Moro chiefs and cachils; for the king was away, as
he had gone to the island of Bachan to be married. <a id="d0e542"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e542">52</a>]</span>The master-of-camp found four Dutch factors there, who were trading for cloves. He learned from them that the ship at Terrenate
was from Holland, and was one of those which had sailed from Amboino and seized Tidore, whence it had driven the Portuguese,
and that it was being laden with cloves. It was awaiting other vessels of its convoy, for they had made friendship and treaties
with Tidore and Terrenate, in order to be protected against the Castilians and Portuguese. The master-of-camp had the king
of Tidore summoned immediately, and, while awaiting Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a, rested his men and cleaned the ships, and made gabions
and other things necessary for the war. Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a, through his pilots&#8217; fault, had gone thirty leguas to leeward of
the island of Terrenate toward the island of Celebes, otherwise called Mateo. Recognizing that island, he returned to Terrenate,
and passing in sight of Talangame, discovered the Dutch vessel. He tried to reconnoiter it, but after seeing that it was harming
his galleys with its artillery, and that the master-of-camp was not there, he proceeded to Tidore, where he found the latter,
to the great joy of all. There they spent the remainder of the month of March. At this juncture the king of Tidore arrived,
with twelve well-armed caracoas. He expressed joy at the governor&#8217;s coming, to whom he complained at length of the tyranny
and subjection in which he was kept by Sultan Zayde,<a id="d0e544src" href="#d0e544" class="noteref">26</a> king of Terrenate, who was aided by the Dutch. He offered to go in person to serve his Majesty in the fleet, with six hundred
men of Tidore. Don Pedro received him and feasted him. Then, without any further delay at Tidore, or any more <a id="d0e550"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e550">53</a>]</span>concern about the ship at Talangame, he set about the chief purpose for which they had come. On the last of March he started
to return to Terrenate. On that day he anchored in a harbor between the settlement and the port, as did also the king of Tidore
with his caracoas. That same night the Dutch ship weighed anchor and went to Amboino. At dawn of next day, April first, soldiers
were landed with some difficulty, with the intention of marching along the shore (which was a very close and narrow stretch)
to the fort, in order to plant the artillery, with which to bombard it. As the governor thought that mischief would ensue
because of the narrowness and closeness of the pass, he landed a number of pioneers on the high ground, to open another road,
so that the remainder of the army might pass, and the enemy be diverted in several directions. By these efforts, he placed
his camp under the walls, although a great number of Terenatans came from various directions to prevent him. The vanguard
of the camp was in charge of Joan Xuarez Gallinato and Captains Joan de Cuevas, Don Rodrigo de Mendo&ccedil;a, Pasqual de Alarcon,
Joan de Cervantes, Captain Vergara, and Cristoval de Villagra, with their companies. The other captains were in the body of
the squadron. The rearguard was under command of Captain Delgado, while the master-of-camp aided in all parts. The army came
up within range of the enemy&#8217;s artillery, which suddenly began to play. The governor came to see how the troops were formed,
and, leaving them at their post, returned to the fleet to have the pieces brought out for bombarding, and to obtain refreshment
for the soldiers. Some high trees intervened between the troops and the wall, in which the <a id="d0e552"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e552">54</a>]</span>enemy had posted some scouts to reconnoiter the field. They were driven down, and our own scouts posted there, who gave advice
from above of what was being done in the fort. Captain Vergara, and after him, Don Rodrigo de Mendo&ccedil;a and Alarcon, went to
reconnoiter the walls, the bastion of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora, and the pieces mounted on the ground there, and a low wall of rough
stone which extended to the mountain, where there was a bastion in which the wall ended. It was called Cachiltulo, and was
defended with pieces of artillery and a number of culverins, muskets, arquebuses, and pikes; while many other weapons peculiar
to the Terenatans were placed along the wall for its defense. Having seen and reconnoitered all this, although not with impunity,
because the enemy had killed six soldiers with the artillery and wounded Alferez Joan de la Rambla in the knee with a musket-ball,
the Spaniards returned to the army. A trifle past noon, a lofty site was reconnoitered, in the direction of the bastion of
Cachiltulo, whence the enemy could be attacked and driven from the wall; and Captain Cuevas was ordered to occupy it with
twenty-five musketeers. Having done this, the enemy sent out a crowd of men to prevent him from occupying it. A skirmish ensued,
and the Moros turned and retreated to their wall. Cuevas followed them so closely and persisted so long, that he needed re&euml;nforcement.
The scouts in the trees gave information of what was being done, whereupon Captains Don Rodrigo de Mendo&ccedil;a, Alarcon, Cervantes,
and Vergara re&euml;nforced him with their light-armed pikemen and halberdiers. They pursued the enemy with so great rapidity and
resolution that they entered the walls behind them. <a id="d0e554"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e554">55</a>]</span>However, some of the Spaniards were wounded, and Captain Cervantes was pushed down from the wall and his legs broken, which
caused his death. Captain Don Rodrigo de Mendo&ccedil;a, pursuing the enemy, who were retiring, ran inside the wall as far as the
cavalier of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora, while Vergara ran in the opposite direction along the curtain of the wall to the bastion of Cachiltulo,
and went on as far as the mountain. By this time the main body of the army had already assaulted the wall. Mutually aiding
one another, they mounted the wall and entered the place on all sides, although with the loss of some dead and wounded soldiers.
The soldiers were stopped by a trench beyond the fort of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora, for the enemy had retreated to a shed, which was
fortified with a considerable number of musketeers and arquebusiers, and four light pieces. They discharged their arquebuses
and muskets at the Spaniards, and threw cane spears hardened in fire, and <i>bacacaes</i>, <a id="d0e559src" href="#d0e559" class="noteref">27</a> after their fashion. The Spaniards assaulted the shed, whereupon a Dutch artilleryman trying to fire a large swivel-gun,
with which he would have done great damage, being confused did not succeed, and threw down the linstock, turned, and fled.
The enemy did the same after him, and abandoned the shed, fleeing in all directions. Those who would do so embarked with the
king and some of his wives and the Dutch in one caracoa and four <i>juangas</i> <a id="d0e568src" href="#d0e568" class="noteref">28</a> which they had <a id="d0e585"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e585">56</a>]</span>armed near the king&#8217;s fort. Captain Vergara entered the fort immediately, but found it deserted. Don Rodrigo de Mendo&ccedil;a and
Villagra pursued the enemy toward the mountain for a long distance, and killed many Moros. With this, at two o&#8217;clock in the
afternoon, the settlement and fort of Terrenate was completely gained. The Spanish banners and standards were flung from it,
without it having been necessary for them to bombard the walls, as they had expected; and the fort was taken at so slight
cost to the Spaniards. Their dead numbered fifteen men, and the wounded twenty more. The whole town was reconnoitered, even
its extremity&#8212;a small fort, called Limataen&#8212;which contained two pieces of artillery, and two other pieces near the mosque
on the seashore. The loot of the place was of small importance, for already the things of most value, and the women and children,
had been removed to the island of Moro, whither the king fled and took refuge in a fort that he had there. Some products of
that land were found, and a great quantity of cloves. In the factory of the Dutch were found two thousand ducados, some cloth
goods and linens, and many weapons, while in many places were excellent Portuguese and Dutch artillery, a number of culverins
and a quantity of ammunition, of which possession was taken for his Majesty. <a id="d0e587src" href="#d0e587" class="noteref">29</a> A guard was placed over what was gained, and the <a id="d0e593"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e593">57</a>]</span>place was put in a condition for defense with some pieces taken from the fleet, while the governor ordered and provided whatever
else was advisable.

</p>
<p>Cachil Amuxa, the king&#8217;s nephew and the greatest chief of Terrenate, came with other cachils to make peace with the governor.
He said that he and all the Terenatans wished to be vassals of his Majesty, and that they would have rendered homage long
before, but the king prevented them. The latter as a proud man, and, confident in his own opinion, although he had been advised
to surrender the fort to his Majesty and render him homage, had steadily refused to do so, having been encouraged and emboldened
by the success that he had gained upon other occasions. That was the reason that he found himself in his present wretched
condition. He offered to induce the king to leave the fort of Moro if given assurance of life. Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a received
this Moro well, and as a Portuguese, Pablo de Lima&#8212;one of those whom the Dutch had driven from Tidore, a man of high standing,
and well acquainted with the king&#8212;offered to accompany him, the governor despatched them with a written passport as follows:


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><i>Passport from Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a to the king of Terrenate</i>


</p>
<p>I, Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a, governor, captain-general, and president of the Filipinas Islands, and general of this army and fleet,
declare that, over my signature, I hereby give security of life to the king of Terrenate, in order that he may come to talk
with me&#8212;both to him and those whom he may bring with him&#8212;reserving to myself the disposal of all the others as I may see fit.
I certify this in his Majesty&#8217;s <a id="d0e604"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e604">58</a>]</span>name. And I order that no person of this fleet molest him or any of his possessions, and that all observe what is herein contained.
Given in Terrenate, April six, one thousand six hundred and six.


</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a</span></p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p>Within nine days Cachilamuja and Pablo de Lima returned to Terrenate with the king, the prince, his son,<a id="d0e612src" href="#d0e612" class="noteref">30</a> and others of his relatives, cachils and sangajes,<a id="d0e618src" href="#d0e618" class="noteref">31</a> under the said passport. They placed themselves under the governor&#8217;s power, and he received them with great affection and
respect. He lodged the king and his son in a good house in the settlement, under guard of a company. The king restored the
villages of Christians that his Majesty had possessed in the island of Moro, when the fort of Terrenate was lost by the Portuguese.
He placed his person and kingdom in his Majesty&#8217;s power, and surrendered a quantity of muskets and heavy artillery that he
had in some forts of the said island. The governor did not despoil him of his kingdom, but on the contrary allowed him to
appoint two of his men to govern, whose choice was to be ratified by himself. The king, his son the prince, and their cachils
and sangajes swore homage to his Majesty. The kings of Tidore and Bachan, and the sangaje of La Bua did the same, and covenanted
and promised not to admit either the Dutch or other nations into Maluco for the clove-trade. They promised, as his Majesty&#8217;s
vassals, to go on all occasions to serve him with their persons, men, and ships, whenever summoned by whomever <a id="d0e624"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e624">59</a>]</span>commanded the fort of Terrenate; that they would oppose no obstacles to the Moros who wished to become Christians; that if
any wicked Christian went to their lands to turn renegade, they would surrender him; and other suitable things. Therewith
great and small were content and pleased, since they were freed from the tyranny of the king of Terrenate. The governor remitted
to them the third part of the tributes which they were wont to pay their king, and gave the Moros other advantages. Then he
planned a new and modern fort, in a very conspicuous and suitable location, and began to build it. In order that the old fort
might be better defended while the new one was being completed, he reduced it to a less size, by making new cavaliers and
bastions, which he finished and furnished with ramparts and stout gates. He commenced another fort in the island of Tidore,
on a good location near the settlement. After placing in order whatever he judged necessary in Terrenate and Tidore, and in
the other towns and fortresses of Maluco, he returned with his fleet to the Filipinas. He left the master-of-camp, Joan de
Esquivel, with a garrison of six hundred soldier&#8212;five hundred, in five companies, for Terrenate&#8212;in the fort of Terrenate to
act as his assistant and as governor of Maluco; he also left there one large forge and a number of smiths, sixty-five pioneers,
thirty-five stonecutters, two galliots, two well-armed brigantines, and crews of rowers. The other company of soldiers [was
to be stationed] in Tidore under command of Captain Alarcon; while ammunition and provisions for one year were left in both
forts. In order to be more assured of the [peaceful] condition of the country, he took the king of Terrenate <a id="d0e626"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e626">60</a>]</span>from it and carried him to Manila, as well as his son the prince, and twenty-four cachils and sangajes, most of them the king&#8217;s
relatives, to whom he showed every honor and good treatment. He explained to them why he took them, and that their return
to Maluco depended upon the security and tranquillity with which the Moros should conduct themselves in their obedience and
service to his Majesty.<a id="d0e628src" href="#d0e628" class="noteref">32</a> The three Portuguese galliots returned to Malaca, taking with them the Dutch who were in Maluco and the Portuguese captains
and soldiers who had come to take part in this expedition. The governor entered Manila in triumph with the remainder of the
fleet, <a id="d0e634"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e634">61</a>]</span>on the last day of May, six hundred and six. He was received there with acclamations of joy and praise from the city, who
gave thanks to God for so happy and prompt result in an undertaking of so great weight and importance.

</p>
<p>During the governor&#8217;s absence in Maluco, the royal Audiencia of the islands governed the Filipinas. The Audiencia wished to
drive a number of Japanese from the city, for they were a turbulent people and promised little security for the country. When
this was attempted and force employed, the Japanese resisted, and the matter came to such a pass that they took arms to oppose
it, and it was necessary for the Spaniards to take their arms also. The affair assumed definite proportions, and some on either
side wished to give battle. However, it was postponed by various means until, through the efforts of certain religious, the
Japanese were quieted; and afterward as many as possible were embarked in vessels, although they resented it greatly. This
was one of the greatest dangers that has threatened Manila, for the Spaniards were few in number, and the Japanese more than
one thousand five hundred, and they are a spirited and very mettlesome race. Had they come to blows on this occasion, the
Spaniards would have fared ill. <a id="d0e638src" href="#d0e638" class="noteref">33</a>

</p>
<p>The governor, upon entering Manila, took over immediately the affairs of his government, especially <a id="d0e654"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e654">62</a>]</span>the despatching of two vessels about to sail to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. He was present in person in the port of Cabit at the equipment
and lading of the ships, and the embarcation of the passengers. He was seized by some indisposition of the stomach which compelled
him to return to Manila and take to his bed. His pain and vomiting increased so rapidly that, without its being possible to
relieve him, he died in great anguish on St. John&#8217;s day, to the great sorrow and grief of the country. Especially did the
king of Terrenate show and express his grief, for he had always received great honor and kind treatment from the governor.
It was suspected that his death had been violent, because of the severity and the symptoms of his illness. The suspicion increased,
because the physicians and surgeons, having opened his body, declared, from the signs that they found, that he had been poisoned,
which made his death more regrettable.<a id="d0e656src" href="#d0e656" class="noteref">34</a> The Audiencia buried the governor in the monastery of St. Augustine at Manila, with the pomp and ostentation due to his person
and offices. Then, again taking charge of the government, the <a id="d0e668"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e668">63</a>]</span>Audiencia despatched the vessels to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, whence advice was sent to his Majesty of the taking of Maluco and the death
of the governor.

</p>
<p>The flagship, in which Don Rodrigo de Mendo&ccedil;a was sailing as general and captain, reached Nueva Espa&ntilde;a quickly with this news.
The almiranta, notwithstanding that it left the islands at the same time, delayed more than six months. Eighty persons who
perished from disease were buried in the sea, while many others stricken by the disease died of it upon landing at the port
of Acapulco. Among these was the licentiate Don Antonio de Ribera, auditor of Manila, who had been appointed auditor of Mexico.

</p>
<p>At the arrival of these vessels, it was learned that since the death of Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a, and the taking over of the government
by the Audiencia, no change had occurred in the affairs of the islands; but that their commerce was restricted because of
the prohibition which forbade sending to the islands more than five hundred thousand pesos each year of the proceeds from
the sale of the merchandise in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. On account of this the people were in need, as this amount appeared little for
the many Spaniards and for the extent of the trade&#8212;by which all classes are sustained, as they have no other resources or
capital. Also, although the gaining of Maluco had been so important for affairs in those islands themselves, and their punishment
for the reduction of the other rebels&#8212;especially those of Mindanao and Jolo, from whom the Filipinas had received so great
injury&#8212;the desirable quiet and stability had not been secured. For the Mindanaos and the Joloans were not yet discontinuing
their descents upon the provinces of the Pintados in their war-vessels, <a id="d0e674"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e674">64</a>]</span>to seize booty according to their custom&#8212;and this will continue until a suitable expedition be sent against them&#8212;and Maluco
affairs were not failing to give Joan de Esquivel, the master-of-camp, sufficient to do. He was acting as governor there and
had but little security from the natives, who, being a Mahometan people, and by nature easily persuaded and fickle, are restless,
and ready for disturbances and wars. Daily and in different parts the natives were being incited and aroused to rebellion;
and although the master-of-camp and his captains were endeavoring to punish and pacify them, they could not do what was necessary
to quiet so many disturbances as arose. The soldiers were dying, and the food giving out; and the aid sent from Manila could
not arrive at the time or in so great quantity as was requested, because of the perils of the voyage and the straits of the
royal treasury.<a id="d0e676src" href="#d0e676" class="noteref">35</a> The coming of vessels to Maluco at this time from Holanda and Zelanda was not less prejudicial to all our interests; for
the Dutch, having so great interests in the islands, and having established their interests there so firmly, were coming in
squadrons by the India route, to recover what they had lost in Amboino, Terrenate, and other islands. With their countenance,
the Moros were revolting against the Spaniards, who had their hands <a id="d0e682"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e682">65</a>]</span>full with them, and more so with the Dutch, for the latter were numerous, and more dangerous enemies than the natives.

</p>
<p>The Dutch interest in these regions is so vast&#8212;both in the clove-trade and that of other drugs and spices, and because they
think that they will have a gateway there for the subjugation of the whole Orient&#8212;that, overcoming all the toil and dangers
of the voyage, they are continually coming to these islands in greater numbers and with larger fleets. If a very fundamental
and timely remedy be not administered in this matter, it will increase to such an extent in a short time that afterward no
remedy can be applied.

</p>
<p>The English and Flemish usually make this voyage by way of the strait of Magallanes. Francisco Draque [Drake] was the first
to make it, and some years later Tomas Liscander [Candish or Cavendish], who passed by Maluco.

</p>
<p>Lately Oliver del Nort, a Fleming, made the voyage. The Spanish fleet fought with his fleet amid the Filipinas Islands, at
the end of the year one thousand six hundred. In this fight, after the capture of his almiranta (which was commanded by Lamberto
Biezman) the flagship, having lost nearly all its crew, and being much disabled, took to flight. And as it afterward left
the Filipinas, and was seen in Sunda and the Java channels, so disabled, it seemed impossible for it to navigate, and that
it would surely be lost, as was recounted above when treating of this.

</p>
<p>This pirate, although so crippled, had the good fortune to escape from the Spaniards, and, after great troubles and hardships,
he returned to Amstradam with his ship &#8220;Mauricio,&#8221; with only nine men alive, reaching it on the twenty-sixth of August in
the year <a id="d0e692"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e692">66</a>]</span>six hundred and one. He wrote the relation and the events of his voyage, and gave plates of the battle and of the ships. This
was afterward translated into Latin and printed by Teodoro de Bri, a German, at Francfort, in the year six hundred and two.
Both relations are going the rounds, and the voyage is regarded as a most prodigious feat and one of so great hardships and
perils. <a id="d0e694src" href="#d0e694" class="noteref">36</a>

</p>
<p>Bartolome Perez, a pilot, gave the same news from the island of La Palma. He, having come from England by way of Holanda,
conversed with Oliver del Nort, and the latter narrated to him his voyage and sufferings, as mentioned by Licentiate Fernando
de la Cueva in a letter from the island of La Palma,<a id="d0e714src" href="#d0e714" class="noteref">37</a> on the last of July, of the year six hundred and four, to Marcos de la Cueva, his brother, who was a resident of Manila,
and one of the volunteers who embarked on the Spanish flagship which fought with the pirate. This letter is as follows.


</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p>I answer two of your Grace&#8217;s letters in this: one dated July, six hundred and one, and the other July, <a id="d0e720"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e720">67</a>]</span>six hundred and two. In both of them your Grace relates to me the shipwreck that befell you and how you saved yourself by
swimming. Long before I saw your Grace&#8217;s letters, I had learned of your mishap, whereat I was very anxious and even quite
grieved; because of what was reported here, I imagined that your Grace had a part in it. Consequently, I was singularly overjoyed
at the assurance that your Grace still possessed life and health. Having them, one can conquer other things; and without them
human treasure has no value. By way of Flandes (whence ships come daily to this island), I learned much, nay, all the event,
although not so minutely. For Oliver de Nort, who was the Dutch general, with whom the engagement occurred, arrived safely
in Holanda, with eight men&#8212;and he made nine&#8212;and without money. His purpose when he left the rebellious states of Holanda and
Zelanda, with five armed vessels laden with merchandise&#8212;which were worth, principal and merchandise, one hundred and fifty
or two hundred thousand ducados&#8212;was to trade and carry on commerce through the strait (and such were his orders), in whatever
parts he should be, with friends or enemies. He was not to attack anyone, but only to defend himself and to incline the Indians
to trade and exchange with him. All the vessels having reached the strait together, three of them became separated there because
of storms, and must have been wrecked; for up to the present nothing has been heard of them. Having seen himself so abandoned,
and that he could not restore his loss by trade, or else because he did not receive a hospitable reception from the inhabitants
of Piru, he determined to exceed his orders, and make that voyage one <a id="d0e722"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e722">68</a>]</span>of plundering. Accordingly he stationed himself at the mouth of the river to await ships. The rest that befell, your Grace
knows. Oliver de Nort is a native of the city of Roterdam, and he reached it with an anchor of wood.<a id="d0e727src" href="#d0e727" class="noteref">38</a> He had no other with which to anchor, nor indeed had he any other left. It is said that this is a very heavy wood of the
Indias, and he has placed it at the door of his house, as a mark of distinction. He arrived, as I say, with nine men, all
told, very much worn out, and as by a miracle. He has printed a book of his voyage, with engravings of his vessels, and many
other details of what happened to him, and the hardships that they endured in the fight and throughout the voyage, both to
show his own glory and to incite others to similar deeds. A pilot of this island, one Bartolome Perez, was seized and taken
to Inglaterra before the peace or truce. He came through Holanda, where he conversed at great length with Oliver. The latter
told him all that had happened to him, which is known to all, and was discussed in this island before that voyage. Bartolome
Perez says that Oliver de Nort praised the Spaniards greatly, and said they were the bravest men he had seen in his life.
They had gained the deck of his ship, and all the upper works, when he cried out from below deck to set fire to the powder,
whereupon he believes that the Spaniards left for fear of being blown up. The Dutch then had an opportunity to escape, but
so crippled were they that their reaching port seems a miracle. The pilot says that he saw the anchor and the book, and what
pertains to the book is stated here. I have recounted <a id="d0e733"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e733">69</a>]</span>this to your Grace, because of the statements in your letter, namely, that people considered them as lost, and so that so
singular a case may be known there.
</p>
</div><p>


</p>
<p>Now the Dutch make the voyage more quickly and more safely, going and coming, by way of India, but not touching at its ports
or coasts, until they reach the islands of the Javas<a id="d0e738src" href="#d0e738" class="noteref">39</a>&#8212;Java major and Java minor&#8212;and Samatra, Amboino, and the Malucas. Since they know the district so well, and have experienced
the immense profits ensuing to them therefrom, it will be difficult to drive them from the Orient, where they have inflicted
so many losses in both spiritual and temporal affairs.

<p>&para; <i>Relation of the Filipinas Islands and of their natives, antiquity, customs, and government, both during the period of their
paganism and after their conquest by the Spaniards, and other details.</i>

</p>
<p>&para; <span class="smallcaps">Chapter Eighth</span>

</p>
<p>The islands of the eastern Ocean Sea, adjacent to farther Asia, belonging to the crown of Espa&ntilde;a, are generally called, by
those who navigate thither by way of the demarcation of Castilla and Castilla&#8217;s seas and lands of America, &#8220;the Western Islands;&#8221;
<a id="d0e767"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e767">70</a>]</span>for from the time that one leaves Espa&ntilde;a, he sails in the course of the sun from east to west, until he reaches them. For
the same reason they are called &#8220;Eastern Islands&#8221; by those who sail from west to east by way of Portuguese India, each of
them circumscribing the world by voyaging in opposite directions, until they meet at these islands, which are numerous and
of varying size; they are properly called Filipinas, and are subject to the crown of Castilla. They lie within the tropic
of Cancer, and extend from twenty-four degrees north latitude to the equinoctial line, which cuts the islands of Maluco. There
are many others on the other side of the line, in the tropic of Capricorn, which extend for twelve degrees in south latitude.<a id="d0e769src" href="#d0e769" class="noteref">40</a> The ancients affirmed that each and all of them were desert and uninhabitable,<a id="d0e775src" href="#d0e775" class="noteref">41</a> but now experience has <a id="d0e804"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e804">71</a>]</span>demonstrated that they deceived themselves; for good climates, many people, and food and other things necessary for human
life are found there, besides many mines of rich metals, with precious gems and pearls, and animals and plants, which nature
has not stinted.

It is impossible to number all the islands&#8212;counting larger and smaller&#8212;of this vast archipelago. Those comprised in the name
and government of Filipinas, number about forty large islands, besides other smaller ones, all consecutive. The chiefest and
best known are Luzon, Mindoro, Tendaya,<a id="d0e806src" href="#d0e806" class="noteref">42</a> Capul, Burias, Mazbate, Marinduque, Leite, Camar, Ybabao, Sebu, Panay, Bohol, Catenduanes, Calamianes, Mindanao, and others
of less renown.

</p>
<p><a id="d0e815"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e815">72</a>]</span>The first island conquered and colonized by the Spaniards was Sebu.<a id="d0e817src" href="#d0e817" class="noteref">43</a> From there the conquest was started and continued in all the neighboring islands. Those islands are inhabited by people,
natives of the same islands, called Vi&ccedil;ayas; or by another name, Pintados&#8212;for the more prominent of the men, from their youth,
tattoo their whole bodies, by pricking them wherever they are marked and then throwing certain black powders over the bleeding
surface, the figures becoming indelible. But, as the chief seat of the government, and the principal Spanish settlement, was
moved to the island of Luzon&#8212;the largest island, and that one nearest and opposite to Great China and Japon&#8212;I shall treat
of it first; for much that will be said of it is similar in the others, to each of whose particulars and distinctive details
I shall pass in due time.

</p>
<p>This island of Luzon extends lengthwise, from the point and head where one enters the Filipinas Islands (by the channel of
Capul, which lies in thirteen and one-half degrees north latitude) to the other <a id="d0e825"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e825">73</a>]</span>point in the province of Cagayan, called Cape Bojeador (and located opposite China, in twenty degrees), more than two hundred
leguas. In some parts its width is more constricted than in others, especially in the middle of the island, where it is so
narrow that it is less than thirty leguas from sea to sea, or from one coast to the other. The whole island is more than four
hundred leguas in circumference.

</p>
<p>The climates of this island are not harmonious; on the contrary, they present a great diversity in its different districts
and provinces. The head and beginning of the island, in the region of the channel, is more temperate in the interior, although
the coasts are hot. The site of the city of Manila is hot, for it is on the coast and is low; but in its vicinity, quite near
the city, there are districts and settlements much cooler, where the heat is not oppressive. The same is true of the other
head of the island, opposite China, named Cagayan. The seasons of the year&#8212;winter and summer&#8212;are contrary to those in Europe;
for the rains generally last in all these islands from the month of June until the month of September, and are accompanied
by heavy showers, whirlwinds, and storms on sea and land. The summer lasts from October to the end of May, with clear skies
and fair winds at sea. However, the winter and rainy season begins earlier in some provinces than in others. <a id="d0e829src" href="#d0e829" class="noteref">44</a> In Cagayan winter and summer almost coincide with those of Espa&ntilde;a, and come at the same seasons.

</p>
<p><a id="d0e836"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e836">74</a>]</span>The people inhabiting the province of Camarines and almost as far as the provinces of Manila, in this great island of Luzon,
both along the coast and in the interior, are natives of this island. They are of medium height, with a complexion like stewed
quinces; and both men and women are well-featured. They have very black hair, and thin beards; and are very clever at anything
that they undertake, keen and passionate, and of great resolution. All live from their labor and gains in the field, their
fishing, and trade, going from island to island by sea, and from province to province by land.

</p>
<p>The natives of the other provinces of this island as far as Cagayan are of the same nature and disposition, except that it
has been learned by tradition that those of Manila and its vicinity were not natives of this island, but came thither in the
past and colonized it; and that they are Malay natives, and come from other islands and remote provinces.<a id="d0e840src" href="#d0e840" class="noteref">45</a>

</p>
<p>In various parts of this island of Luzon are found a number of natives black in color. Both men and women have woolly hair,
and their stature is not very great, although they are strong and robust. These people are barbarians, and have but little
capacity. They possess no fixed houses or settlements, but wander in bands and hordes through the mountains and rough country,
changing from one site to another <a id="d0e851"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e851">75</a>]</span>according to the season. They support themselves in certain clearings, and by planting rice, which they do temporarily, and
by means of the game that they bring down with their bows, in the use of which they are very skilful and certain.<a id="d0e853src" href="#d0e853" class="noteref">46</a> They live also on honey from the mountains, and roots produced by the ground. They are a barbarous people, in whom one cannot
place confidence. They are much given to killing and to attacking the settlements of the other natives, in which they commit
many depredations; and there is nothing that can be done to stop them, or to subdue or pacify them, although this is always
attempted by fair or foul means, as opportunity and necessity demand.

</p>
<p>The province of Cagayan is inhabited by natives of the same complexion as the others of the island, although they are better
built, and more valiant and warlike than the others. They wear their hair long and hanging down the back. They have been in
revolt and rebellion twice since the first time when they were pacified; and there has been plenty to do, on different occasions,
in subduing them and repacifying them.

</p>
<p>The apparel and clothing of these natives of Luzon before the entrance of the Spaniards into the country were generally, for
the men, certain short collarless garments of <i>cangan</i>, sewed together in the front, and with short sleeves, and reaching slightly below the waist; some were blue and others black,
while the <a id="d0e869"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e869">76</a>]</span>chiefs had some red ones, called <i>chinanas</i>.<a id="d0e874src" href="#d0e874" class="noteref">47</a> They also wore a strip of colored cloth wrapped about the waist, and passed between the legs, so that it covered the privy
parts, reaching half-way down the thigh; these are called <i>bahaques</i>.<a id="d0e898src" href="#d0e898" class="noteref">48</a> They go with legs bare, feet unshod, and the head uncovered, wrapping a narrow cloth, called <i>potong</i><a id="d0e906src" href="#d0e906" class="noteref">49</a> just below it, with which they bind the forehead and temples. About their necks they wear gold necklaces, wrought like spun
wax,<a id="d0e921src" href="#d0e921" class="noteref">50</a> and with links in our fashion, some larger than others. On their arms they wear armlets of wrought gold, which they call
<i>calombigas</i>, and which are very large and made in different patterns. Some <a id="d0e936"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e936">77</a>]</span>wear strings of precious stones&#8212;cornelians and agates; and other blue and white stones, which they esteem highly.<a id="d0e938src" href="#d0e938" class="noteref">51</a> They wear around the legs some strings of these stones, and certain cords, covered with black pitch in many foldings, as
garters.<a id="d0e944src" href="#d0e944" class="noteref">52</a>

</p>
<p>In a province called Zambales, they wear the head shaved from the middle forward. On the skull they have a huge lock of loose
hair.<a id="d0e955src" href="#d0e955" class="noteref">53</a> The women throughout this island wear small jackets [<i>sayuelos</i>] with sleeves of the same kinds of cloth and of all colors, called <i>varos</i>.<a id="d0e967src" href="#d0e967" class="noteref">54</a> They wear no shifts, but certain white cotton garments which are wrapped about the waist and fall to the feet, while other
dyed cloths are wrapped about the body, like kirtles, and are very graceful. The principal women have crimson ones, and some
of silk, while others are woven with gold, and adorned with fringe and other ornaments. They wear many gold necklaces about
the neck, calumbigas on the wrists, large earrings of wrought gold in the ears, and rings of gold and precious stones. Their
black hair is done up in a very graceful knot on the head. Since the Spaniards came to the country many Indians do not wear
<i>bahaques</i>, but wide <a id="d0e976"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e976">78</a>]</span>drawers of the same cloths and materials, and hats on their heads. The chiefs wear braids of wrought gold containing many
designs, while many of them wear shoes. The chief women also wear beautiful shoes, many of them having shoes of velvet adorned
with gold, and white garments like petticoats.

</p>
<p>Men and women, and especially the chief people, are very clean and neat in their persons and clothing, and of pleasing address
and grace. They dress their hair carefully, and regard it as being more ornamental when it is very black. They wash it with
water in which has been boiled the bark of a tree called <i>gogo</i>.<a id="d0e983src" href="#d0e983" class="noteref">55</a> They anoint it with aljonjoli oil, prepared with musk, and other perfumes. All are very careful of their teeth, which from
a very early age they file and render even, with stones and iron.<a id="d0e989src" href="#d0e989" class="noteref">56</a> They dye them a black color, which is lasting, and which preserves their teeth until they are very old, although it is ugly
to look at.<a id="d0e995src" href="#d0e995" class="noteref">57</a>

</p>
<p>They quite generally bathe the entire body in the rivers and creeks, both young and old, without reflecting that it could
at any time be injurious to them;<a id="d0e1003src" href="#d0e1003" class="noteref">58</a> for in their baths do they find their best <a id="d0e1009"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1009">79</a>]</span>medicines. When an infant is born, they immediately bathe it, and the mother likewise. The women have needlework as their
employment and occupation, and they are very clever at it, and at all kinds of sewing. They weave cloth and spin cotton, and
serve in the houses of their husbands and fathers. They pound the rice for eating,<a id="d0e1011src" href="#d0e1011" class="noteref">59</a> and prepare the other food. They raise fowls and swine, and keep the houses, while the men are engaged in the labors of the
field, and in their fishing, navigation, and trading. They are not very chaste, either single or married women; while their
husbands, fathers, or brothers are not very jealous or anxious about it. Both men and women are so selfish and greedy that,
if they are paid, they are easily won over. When the husband finds his wife in adultery, he is smoothed and pacified without
any trouble&#8212;although, since they have known Spaniards, some of those who assume to be more enlightened among them have sometimes
killed the adulterers. Both men and women, especially the chiefs, walk slowly and sedately when upon their visits, and when
going through the streets and to the temples; and are accompanied by many slaves, both male and female, with parasols of silk
which they carry to protect them from the sun and rain. The women walk ahead and their female servants and slaves follow them;
behind these walk their husbands, fathers, or brothers, with their man-servants and slaves.<a id="d0e1017src" href="#d0e1017" class="noteref">60</a>

</p>
<p>Their ordinary food is rice pounded in wooden <a id="d0e1025"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1025">80</a>]</span>mortars, and cooked&#8212;this is called <i>morisqueta</i>,<a id="d0e1030src" href="#d0e1030" class="noteref">61</a> and is the ordinary bread of the whole country&#8212;boiled fish (which is very abundant), the flesh of swine, deer, and wild buffaloes
(which they call <i>carabaos</i>). Meat and fish they relish better when it has begun to spoil and when it stinks.<a id="d0e1042src" href="#d0e1042" class="noteref">62</a> They also eat boiled camotes (which are sweet potatoes), beans, <i>quilites</i><a id="d0e1053src" href="#d0e1053" class="noteref">63</a> and other vegetables; all kinds of bananas, guavas, pineapples, custard apples, many varieties of oranges, and other varieties
of fruits and herbs, with which the country teems. Their drink is a wine made from the tops of cocoa and nipa palm, of which
there is a great abundance. They are grown and tended like vineyards, although without so much toil and labor. Drawing off
the tuba,<a id="d0e1062src" href="#d0e1062" class="noteref">64</a> they distil it, using for alembics their own little furnaces and utensils, to a greater or less strength, and it becomes
brandy. This is drunk throughout the islands. It is a wine of the clarity of water, but strong and dry. If it be used with
moderation, it acts as a medicine for the stomach, and is a protection against humors and all sorts of rheums. Mixed with
Spanish wine, it makes a mild liquor, and one very palatable and healthful.

</p>
<p>In the assemblies, marriages, and feasts of the natives of these islands, the chief thing consists in drinking this wine,
day and night, without ceasing, <a id="d0e1073"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1073">81</a>]</span>when the turn of each comes, some singing and others drinking. As a consequence, they generally become intoxicated without
this vice being regarded as a dishonor or disgrace.<a id="d0e1075src" href="#d0e1075" class="noteref">65</a>

</p>
<p>The weapons of this people are, in some provinces, bow and arrows. But those generally used throughout the islands are moderate-sized
spears with well-made points; and certain shields of light wood, with their armholes fastened on the inside. These cover them
from top to toe, and are called <i>carasas</i> [<i>kalasag</i>]. At the waist they carry a dagger four fingers in breadth, the blade pointed, and a third of a vara in length; the hilt
is of gold or ivory. The pommel is open and has two cross bars or projections, without any other guard. They are called <i>bararaos</i>. They have two cutting edges, and are kept in wooden scabbards, or those of buffalo-horn, admirably wrought.<a id="d0e1092src" href="#d0e1092" class="noteref">66</a> With these they strike with the point, but more generally with the edge. When they go in pursuit of their opponent, they
show great dexterity in seizing his hair with one hand, while with the other they cut off his head with one stroke of the
bararao, and carry it away. They afterward keep the heads suspended in their houses, where they may be seen; and <a id="d0e1109"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1109">82</a>]</span>of these they make a display, in order to be considered as valiant, and avengers of their enemies and of the injuries committed
by them.<a id="d0e1111src" href="#d0e1111" class="noteref">67</a>

</p>
<p>Since they have seen the Spaniards use their weapons, many of the natives handle the arquebuses and muskets quite skilfully.
Before the arrival of the Spaniards they had bronze culverins and other pieces of cast iron, with which they defended their
forts and settlements, although their powder is not so well refined as that of the Spaniards.

</p>
<p>Their ships and boats are of many kinds; for on the rivers and creeks inland they use certain very large canoes, each made
from one log, and others fitted with benches and made from planks, and built up on keels. They have vireys and barangays,
which are certain quick and light vessels that lie low in the water, put together with little wooden nails. These are as slender
at the stern as at the bow, and they can hold a number of rowers on both sides, who propel their vessels with <i>buc&ccedil;eyes</i> or paddles, and with <i>gaones</i><a id="d0e1126src" href="#d0e1126" class="noteref">68</a> on the outside of the vessel; and they time their rowing to the accompaniment of some who sing in their language refrains
by which they understand whether to hasten or retard their rowing.<a id="d0e1132src" href="#d0e1132" class="noteref">69</a> Above the rowers is a platform or gangway, built of bamboo, upon which the fighting-men stand, in order not to interfere
with the rowing of the oarsmen. In <a id="d0e1135"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1135">83</a>]</span>accordance with the capacity of the vessels is the number of men on these gangways. From that place they manage the sail,
which is square and made of linen, and hoisted on a support or yard made of two thick bamboos, which serves as a mast. When
the vessel is large, it also has a foresail of the same form. Both yards, with their tackle, can be lowered upon the gangway
when the weather is rough. The helmsmen are stationed in the stern to steer. It carries another bamboo framework on the gangway
itself; and upon this, when the sun shines hot, or it rains, they stretch an awning made from some mats, woven from palm-leaves.
These are very bulky and close, and are called <i>cayanes</i><a id="d0e1139src" href="#d0e1139" class="noteref">70</a> Thus all the ship and its crew are covered and protected. There are also other bamboo frameworks for each side of the vessel,
which are so long as the vessel, and securely fastened on. They skim the water, without hindering the rowing, and serve as
a counterpoise, so that the ship cannot overturn nor upset, however heavy the sea, or strong the wind against the sail. It
may happen that the entire hull of these vessels, which have no decks, may fill with water and remain between wind and water,
even until it is destroyed and broken up, without sinking, because of these counterpoises. These vessels have been used commonly
throughout the islands since olden times. They have other larger vessels called caracoas, <i>lapis</i>, and <i>tapaques</i>, which are used to carry their merchandise, and which are very suitable, as they are roomy and draw but little water. They
generally drag them ashore every night, at the mouths of rivers and creeks, among which they always <a id="d0e1156"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1156">84</a>]</span>navigate without going into the open sea or leaving the shore. All the natives can row and manage these boats. Some are so
long that they can carry one hundred rowers on a side and thirty soldiers above to fight. The boats commonly used are barangays
and vireys, which carry a less crew and fighting force. Now they put many of them together with iron nails instead of the
wooden pegs and the joints in the planks, while the helms and bows have beaks like Castilian boats.<a id="d0e1158src" href="#d0e1158" class="noteref">71</a>

</p>
<p>The land is well shaded in all parts by trees of different kinds, and fruit-trees which beautify it throughout the year, both
along the shore and inland among the plains and mountains. It is very full of large and small rivers, of good fresh water,
which flow into the sea. All of them are navigable, and abound in all kinds of fish, which are very pleasant to the taste.
For the above reason there is a large supply of lumber, which is cut and sawed, dragged to the rivers, and brought down, by
the natives. This lumber is very useful for houses and buildings, and for the construction of small and large vessels. Many
<a id="d0e1166"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1166">87</a>]</span>very straight thick trees, light and pliable, are found, which are used as masts for ships and galleons. Consequently, vessels
of any size may be fitted with masts from these trees, made of one piece of timber, without its being necessary to splice
them or make them of different pieces. For the hulls of the ships, the keels, futtock-timbers, top-timbers, and any other
kinds of supports and braces, compass-timbers, transoms, knees small and large, and rudders, all sorts of good timber are
easily found; as well as good planking for the sides, decks, and upper-works, from very suitable woods.<a id="d0e1168src" href="#d0e1168" class="noteref">72</a>

</p>
<p>There are many native fruit-trees, such as the <i>sanctors</i>, <i>mabolos</i>, tamarinds, <i>nancas</i>, custard-apples, papaws, guavas, and everywhere many oranges, of all kinds&#8212;large and small, sweet and sour; citrons, lemons,
and ten or twelve varieties of very healthful and palatable bananas.<a id="d0e1208src" href="#d0e1208" class="noteref">73</a> There are many cocoa-palms <a id="d0e1248"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1248">88</a>]</span>bearing fruit of pleasant taste&#8212;from which is made wine and common oil, which is a very healing remedy for wounds; and other
wild palms of the forests&#8212;that do not yield cocoa-nuts, but serve as wood, and from whose bark is made bonote, a tow for rigging
and cables, and also for calking ships. Efforts have been made to plant olives and quinces, and other fruit-trees of Espa&ntilde;a,
but as yet they have had no success, except with pomegranates and grapevines, which bear fruit the second year. These bear
abundance of exceedingly good grapes three times a year; and some fig-trees have succeeded. Vegetables of every kind grow
well and very abundantly, but do not seed, and it is always necessary to bring the seeds from Castilla, China, or Japon.

</p>
<p>In the Cagayan provinces are found chestnut-trees, which produce fruit. In other districts are found pines and other trees
which yield certain very large <a id="d0e1252"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1252">89</a>]</span>pine-nuts, with a hard shell and a pleasant taste, which are called piles.<a id="d0e1254src" href="#d0e1254" class="noteref">74</a> There is abundance of cedar which is called <i>calanta</i>, a beautiful red wood called <i>asana</i>,<a id="d0e1269src" href="#d0e1269" class="noteref">75</a> ebony of various qualities, and many other precious woods for all uses. The meat generally eaten is that of swine, of which
there is a great abundance, and it is very palatable and wholesome.

</p>
<p>Beef is eaten, cattle being raised abundantly in stock-farms in many different parts of the islands. The cattle are bred from
those of China and Nueva Espa&ntilde;a.<a id="d0e1298src" href="#d0e1298" class="noteref">76</a> The Chinese cattle are small, and excellent breeders. Their horns are very small and twisted, <a id="d0e1304"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1304">90</a>]</span>and some cattle can move them. They have a large hump upon the shoulders, and are very manageable beasts. There are plenty
of fowls like those of Castilla, and others very large, which are bred from fowls brought from China. They are very palatable,
and make fine capons. Some of these fowls are black in feather, skin, flesh, and bones, and are pleasant to the taste.<a id="d0e1306src" href="#d0e1306" class="noteref">77</a> Many geese are raised, as well as swans, ducks, and tame pigeons brought from China. There is abundance of flesh of wild
game, such as venison, and wild boars, and in some parts porcupines. There are many buffaloes, which are called carabaos,
which are raised in the fields and are very spirited; others are brought tame from China; these are very numerous, and very
handsome. These last are used only for milking, and their milk is thicker and more palatable than that of cows.

</p>
<p>Goats and kids are raised, although their flesh is not savory, because of the humidity of the country. These animals sicken
and die for that reason, and because they eat certain poisonous herbs. Ewes and rams, although often brought from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a,
never multiply. Consequently there are none of these animals, for the climate and pasturage has not as yet seemed suitable
for them.<a id="d0e1317src" href="#d0e1317" class="noteref">78</a> There were no horses, mares, or asses in the islands, until the Spaniards had them brought from China and brought them from
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. Asses and mules are very rare, but there are many horses and mares. Some farms are being stocked with them,
and those born there (mixed <a id="d0e1323"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1323">91</a>]</span>breeds for the most part) turn out well, and have good colors, are good tempered and willing to work, and are of medium size.
Those brought from China are small, very strong, good goers, treacherous, quarrelsome, and bad-tempered. Some horses of good
colors are brought from Japon. They have well-shaped bodies, thick hair, large fetlocks, large legs and front hoofs, which
makes them look like draft-horses. Their heads are rather large, and their mouths hard. They run but slowly, but walk well,
and are spirited, and of much mettle. The daily feed of the horses consists throughout the year of green provender,<a id="d0e1325src" href="#d0e1325" class="noteref">79</a> besides rice in the husk, which keeps them very fat.<a id="d0e1331src" href="#d0e1331" class="noteref">80</a>

</p>
<p>There are many fowls and field birds, and wild birds of wonderful colors and very beautiful. There are no singing birds suitable
for keeping in cages, although some calendar larks [<i>Calandrias</i>] called <i>fimbaros</i>,<a id="d0e1362src" href="#d0e1362" class="noteref">81</a> smaller than those of Espa&ntilde;a, are brought from Japon, whose song is most sweet. There are many turtle-doves, ring-doves;
other doves with an extremely green plumage, and red feet and beaks; and others that are white with a red spot on the breast,
like a pelican. Instead of quail, there are <a id="d0e1374"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1374">92</a>]</span>certain birds resembling them, but smaller, which are called <i>povos</i><a id="d0e1378src" href="#d0e1378" class="noteref">82</a> and other smaller birds called mayuelas.<a id="d0e1395src" href="#d0e1395" class="noteref">83</a> There are many wild chickens and cocks, which are very small, and taste like partridge. There are royal, white, and grey
herons, flycatchers, and other shore birds, ducks, lavancos,<a id="d0e1419src" href="#d0e1419" class="noteref">84</a> crested cranes, sea-crows, eagles, eagle-owls, and other birds of prey, although none are used for hawking. There are jays
and thrushes as in Espa&ntilde;a, and white storks and cranes.<a id="d0e1431src" href="#d0e1431" class="noteref">85</a> They do not rear peacocks, rabbits, or hares, although they have tried to do so. It is believed that the wild animals in
the forests and fields eat and destroy them, namely, the cats, foxes, badgers, and large and small rats, which are very numerous,
and other land animals.<a id="d0e1443src" href="#d0e1443" class="noteref">86</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e1450"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1450">93</a>]</span>Throughout these islands are found a great number of monkeys, of various sizes, with which at times the trees are covered.
There are green and white parrots, but they are stupid in talking; and very small parroquets, of beautiful green and red colors,
which talk as little. The forests and settlements have many serpents, of various colors, which are generally larger than those
of Castilla. Some have been seen in the forests of unusual size, and wonderful to behold.<a id="d0e1452src" href="#d0e1452" class="noteref">87</a> The most harmful are certain slender snakes, of less than one vara in length, which dart down upon passersby from the trees
(where they generally hang), and sting them; their venom is so powerful that within twenty-four hours the person dies raving.

</p>
<p>There are many very large scorpions in the rivers and creeks, and a great number of crocodiles, which are very bloodthirsty
and cruel. They quite commonly pull from their bancas the natives who go in those boats, and cause many injuries among the
horned cattle and the horses of the stock-farms, when they go to drink. And although the people fish for them often and kill
them, they are never diminished in number. For that reason, the natives set closely-grated divisions and enclosures in the
rivers and creeks of their settlements, where they bathe. There they enter the water to bathe, secure from those monsters,
which they fear so greatly that they venerate and adore them, as if they were beings superior to themselves. All their oaths
and execrations, and those which are of any weight with them (even among the Christians) are, thus expressed: &#8220;So may <a id="d0e1460"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1460">94</a>]</span>the crocodile kill him!&#8221; They call the crocodile <i>buhaya</i> in their language. It has happened when some one has sworn falsely, or when he has broken his word, that then some accident
has occurred to him with the crocodile, which God, whom he offends, has so permitted for the sake of the authority and purity
of the truth, and the promise of it.<a id="d0e1465src" href="#d0e1465" class="noteref">88</a>

</p>
<p>The fisheries of sea and rivers are most abundant, and include all kinds of fish; both of fresh and salt water. These are
generally used as food throughout the entire country. There are many good sardines, sea-eels, sea-breams (which they call
<i>bacocos</i>), daces, skates, <i>bicudas</i>, <i>tanguingues</i>, soles, <i>plantanos</i>,<a id="d0e1490src" href="#d0e1490" class="noteref">89</a> <i>taraquitos</i>, needle-fish, gilt-heads, and eels; large oysters, mussels,<a id="d0e1502src" href="#d0e1502" class="noteref">90</a> <i>por&ccedil;ebes</i>, crawfish, shrimp, sea-spiders, center-fish, and all kinds of cockles, shad, white fish, and in the Tajo River of Cagayan,<a id="d0e1510src" href="#d0e1510" class="noteref">91</a> during their season, a great number of <i>bobos</i>, which <a id="d0e1519"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1519">95</a>]</span>come down to spawn at the bar. In the lake of Bonbon, a quantity of tunny-fish, not so large as those of Espa&ntilde;a, but of the
same shape, flesh, and taste, are caught. Many sea-fish are found in the sea, such as whales, sharks, <i>caellas</i>, <i>marajos</i>, <i>bufeos</i>, and other unknown species of extraordinary forms and size. In the year of five hundred and ninety-six, during a furious
storm in the islands, a fish was flung into shallow water on one of the Luzon coasts near the province of Camarines. It was
so huge and misshapen, that although it lay in more than three and one-half bra&ccedil;as of water, it could not again get afloat,
and died there. The natives said that they had never seen anything like it, nor another shaped like it. Its head was of wonderful
size and fierce aspect. On its frontal it bore two horns, which pointed toward its back. One of them was taken to Manila.
It was covered with its skin or hide, but had no hair or scales. It was white, and twenty feet long. Where it joined the head
it was as thick as the thigh, and gradually tapered proportionally to the tip. It was somewhat curved and not very round;
and to all appearances, quite solid. It caused great wonder in all beholders.<a id="d0e1530src" href="#d0e1530" class="noteref">92</a>

</p>
<p>There is a fresh-water lake in the island of Luzon, five leguas from Manila, which contains a quantity of fish. Many rivers
flow into this lake, and it empties into the sea through the river flowing from it to Manila. It is called La Laguna de Bay
[&#8220;Bay Lake&#8221;]. It is thirty leguas in circumference, and has an uninhabited island in its middle, where game abounds.<a id="d0e1538src" href="#d0e1538" class="noteref">93</a> Its shores are lined with many native villages. <a id="d0e1544"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1544">96</a>]</span>The natives navigate the lake, and commonly cross it in their skiffs. At times it is quite stormy and dangerous to navigate,
when the north winds blow, for these winds make it very boisterous, although it is very deep.

</p>
<p>Twenty leguas from Manila, in the province of Bonbon, is another lake of the same name [Bonbon], not so extensive as the former,
but with a great abundance of fish. The natives&#8217; method of catching them is by making corrals<a id="d0e1548src" href="#d0e1548" class="noteref">94</a> of bejucos, which are certain slender canes or rushes, solid and very pliant and strong; these are employed for making cables
for the natives&#8217; boats, as well as other kinds of ropes. They catch the fish inside these corrals, having made the enclosures
fast by means of stakes. They also catch the fish in wicker baskets made from the <i>bejucos</i>, but most generally with <i>atarrayas</i>,<a id="d0e1557src" href="#d0e1557" class="noteref">95</a> <i>esparaveles</i>, other small <i>barrederas</i>,<a id="d0e1566src" href="#d0e1566" class="noteref">96</a> and with hand lines and hooks.<a id="d0e1574src" href="#d0e1574" class="noteref">97</a> The most usual food of the natives is a fish as small as <i>pejerreyes</i>.<a id="d0e1583src" href="#d0e1583" class="noteref">98</a> They dry and cure these fish in the sun and air, and cook them in many styles. They like them better than large fish. It
is called <i>laulau</i> among them.<a id="d0e1589src" href="#d0e1589" class="noteref">99</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e1620"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1620">97</a>]</span>Instead of olives and other pickled fruit, they have a green fruit, like walnuts, which they call <i>paos</i>.<a id="d0e1625src" href="#d0e1625" class="noteref">100</a> Some are small, and others larger in size, and when prepared they have a pleasant taste. They also prepare <i>charas</i><a id="d0e1633src" href="#d0e1633" class="noteref">101</a> in pickle brine, and all sorts of vegetables and greens, which are very appetizing. There is much ginger, and it is eaten
green, pickled, and preserved. There are also quantities of <i>cachumba</i><a id="d0e1638src" href="#d0e1638" class="noteref">102</a> instead of saffron and other condiments. The ordinary dainty throughout these islands, and in many kingdoms of the mainland
of those regions, is <i>buyo</i> [betel]. This is made from a tree,<a id="d0e1662src" href="#d0e1662" class="noteref">103</a> whose leaf is shaped like that of the mulberry. The fruit resembles an oak acorn, and is white inside.<a id="d0e1668src" href="#d0e1668" class="noteref">104</a> This <a id="d0e1683"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1683">98</a>]</span>fruit, which is called <i>bonga</i>, is cut lengthwise in strips, and each strip is put into an envelope or covering made from the leaf. With the <i>bonga</i> is thrown in a powder of quick lime.<a id="d0e1691src" href="#d0e1691" class="noteref">105</a> This compound is placed in the mouth and chewed. It is so strong a mixture, and burns so much, that it induces sleep and
intoxication. It burns the mouths of those not used to it, and causes them to smart. The saliva and all the mouth are made
as red as blood. It does not taste bad. After having been chewed<a id="d0e1706src" href="#d0e1706" class="noteref">106</a> for a considerable time it is spit out, when it no longer has any juice, which is called &ccedil;apa [sap&aacute;]. They consider very
beneficial that quantity of the juice which has gone into the stomach, for strengthening it, and for various diseases. It
strengthens and preserves the teeth and gums from all inflammations, decay, and aches. They tell other wonderful effects of
it. What has been seen is that the natives and Spaniards&#8212;laymen and religious, men and women&#8212;use it so commonly and generally
that mornings and afternoons, at parties and visits, and even alone in their houses, all their refreshments and luxuries consist
of buyos served on heavily-gilded and handsomely adorned plates and trays like chocolate in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. In these poison
has been often administered from which the persons eating them have died, and that quite commonly.

</p>
<p>The natives (especially the chiefs) take whenever they leave their houses, for show and entertainment, <a id="d0e1717"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1717">99</a>]</span>their boxes of buyos&#8212;which they call <i>buccetas</i><a id="d0e1721src" href="#d0e1721" class="noteref">107</a>&#8212;ready to use, and the leaf, <i>bonga</i>, and quick lime, separately. With these handsome boxes, which are made of metal and of other materials, they carry the scissors
and other tools for making the buyo with cleanliness and neatness. Wherever they may stop, they make and use their buyo. In
the pari&aacute;ns, or bazars, buyos are sold ready made, and the outfit for making them.<a id="d0e1736src" href="#d0e1736" class="noteref">108</a>

</p>
<p>The natives of these islands quite commonly use as venoms and poisons the herbs of that class found throughout the islands.
They are so efficacious and deadly that they produce wonderful effects. There is a lizard, commonly found in the houses, somewhat
dark-green in color, one palmo long, and as thick as three fingers, which is called <i>chacon</i>.<a id="d0e1753src" href="#d0e1753" class="noteref">109</a> They put this in a joint of bamboo, and cover it up. The slaver of this animal during its imprisonment is gathered. It is
an exceedingly strong poison, when introduced as above stated, in the food or drink, in however minute quantities. There are
various herbs known and gathered by the natives for the same use. Some of them are used dry, and others green; some are to
be mixed in food, and others inhaled. Some kill by simply touching them with the hands or feet, or by sleeping upon them.
The natives are so skilful in making compounds from these substances, that they mix and apply them in such a manner that they
take <a id="d0e1762"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1762">100</a>]</span>effect at once, or at a set time&#8212;long or short, as they wish, even after a year. Many persons usually die wretchedly by these
means&#8212;especially Spaniards, who lack foresight, and who are tactless and hated because of the ill-treatment that they inflict
upon the natives with whom they deal, either in the collection of their tributes, or in other matters in which they employ
them, without there being any remedy for it. There are certain poisonous herbs, with which, when the natives gather them,
they carry, all ready, other herbs which act as antidotes. In the island of Bohol is one herb of such nature that the natives
approach it from windward when they cut it from the shrub on which it grows; for the very air alone that blows over the herb
is deadly. Nature did not leave this danger without a remedy, for other herbs and roots are found in the same islands, of
so great efficacy and virtue that they destroy and correct the poison and mischief of the others, and are used when needed.
Accordingly, when one knows what poison has been given him, it is not difficult, if recourse be had in time, to cure it, by
giving the herb that is antidotal to such poison. At times it has happened that pressure has been put upon the person suspected
of having committed the evil to make him bring the antidote, by which it has been remedied. There are also other general antidotes,
both for preservation against poison and for mitigating the effects of poison that has been administered. But the most certain
and efficacious antidotes are certain small flies or insects, of a violet color, found on certain bushes in the islands of
Pintados. These are shut up in a clean bamboo joint, and covered over. There they breed and multiply. Ground rice is put in
with them, and they exist thereon. <a id="d0e1764"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1764">101</a>]</span>Every week they are visited<a id="d0e1766src" href="#d0e1766" class="noteref">110</a> and the old rice removed and new rice put in, and they are kept alive by this means. If six of these insects are taken in
a spoonful of wine or water&#8212;for they emit no bad odor, and taste like cress&#8212;they produce a wonderful effect. Even when people
go to banquets or dinners where there is any suspicion, they are wont to take with them these insects, in order to preserve
and assure themselves from any danger of poison and venom.

</p>
<p>All these islands are, in many districts, rich in placers and mines of gold, a metal which the natives dig and work. However,
since the advent of the Spaniards in the land, the natives proceed more slowly in this, and content themselves with what they
already possess in jewels and gold ingots, handed down from antiquity and inherited from their ancestors.<a id="d0e1777src" href="#d0e1777" class="noteref">111</a> This is considerable, for he must be poor and wretched who has no gold chains, calombigas [bracelets], and earrings.

</p>
<p>Some placers and mines were worked at Paracali in the province of Camarines, where there is good gold <a id="d0e1785"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1785">102</a>]</span>mixed with copper. This commodity is also traded in the Ylocos, for at the rear of this province, which borders the seacoast,
are certain lofty and rugged mountains which extend as far as Cagayan. On the slopes of these mountains, in the interior,
live many natives, as yet unsubdued, and among whom no incursion has been made, who are called Ygolotes. These natives possess
rich mines, many of gold and silver mixed. They are wont to dig from them only the amount necessary for their wants. They
descend to certain places to trade this gold (without completing its refining or preparation), with the Ylocos; there they
exchange it for rice, swine, carabaos, cloth, and other things that they need.<a id="d0e1787src" href="#d0e1787" class="noteref">112</a> The Ylocos complete its refining and preparation, and by their medium it is distributed throughout the country. Although
an effort has been made with these Ygolotes to discover their mines, and how they work them, and their method of working the
metal, nothing definite has been learned, for the Ygolotes fear that the Spaniards will go to seek them for their gold, and
say that they keep the gold better in the earth than in their houses.<a id="d0e1793src" href="#d0e1793" class="noteref">113</a>

</p>
<p>There are also many gold mines and placers in the other islands, especially among the Pintados, on the Botuan River in Mindanao,
and in Sebu, where a mine of good gold is worked, called Taribon. If the <a id="d0e1807"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1807">103</a>]</span>industry and efforts of the Spaniards were to be converted into the working of the gold, as much would be obtained from any
one of these islands as from those provinces which produce the most in the world. But since they attend to other means of
gain rather than to this, as will be told in due time, they do not pay the proper attention to this matter.

</p>
<p>In some of these islands pearl oysters are found, especially in the Calamianes, where some have been obtained that are large
and exceedingly clear and lustrous.<a id="d0e1811src" href="#d0e1811" class="noteref">114</a> Neither is this means of profit utilized. In all parts, seed pearls are found in the ordinary oysters, and there are oysters
as large as a buckler. From the [shells of the] latter the natives manufacture beautiful articles. There are also very large
sea turtles in all the islands. Their shells are utilized by the natives, and sold as an article of commerce to the Chinese
and Portuguese, and other nations who go after them and esteem them highly, because of the beautiful things made from them.

</p>
<p>On the coasts of any of these islands are found many small white snail shells, called <i>siguei</i>. The natives gather them and sell them by measure to the Siamese, Cambodians, Pantanes, and other peoples of the mainland.
It serves there as money, and those nations trade with it, as they do with cacao-beans in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a.<a id="d0e1819src" href="#d0e1819" class="noteref">115</a>

</p>
<p>Carabao horns are used as merchandise in trading <a id="d0e1832"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1832">104</a>]</span>with China; and deerskins and dye-wood with Japon. The natives make use of everything in trading with those nations and derive
much profit therefrom.

</p>
<p>In this island of Luzon, especially in the provinces of Manila, Panpanga, Pangasinan, and Ylocos, certain earthenware jars
[<i>tibores</i>] are found among the natives. They are very old, of a brownish color, and not handsome. Some are of medium size, and others
are smaller, and they have certain marks and stamps. The natives are unable to give any explanation of where or when they
got them, for now they are not brought to the islands or made there. The Japanese seek them and esteem them, for they have
found that the root of a plant called <i>cha</i> [tea]&#8212;which is drunk hot, as a great refreshment and medicine, among the kings and lords of Japon&#8212;is preserved and keeps
only in these tibors. These are so highly valued throughout Japon, that they are regarded as the most precious jewels of their
closets and household furniture. A tibor is worth a great sum, and the Japanese adorn them outside with fine gold beautifully
chased, and keep them in brocade cases. Some tibors are valued and sold for two thousand taes of eleven reals to the tae,
or for less, according to the quality of the tibor. It makes no difference if they are cracked or chipped, for that does not
hinder them from holding the tea. The natives of these islands sell them to the Japanese for the best price possible, and
seek them carefully for this profit. However, few are found now, because of the assiduity with which the natives have applied
themselves to that search.<a id="d0e1842src" href="#d0e1842" class="noteref">116</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e1852"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1852">105</a>]</span>At times the natives have found large pieces of ambergris on the coasts. When they discovered that the Spaniards value it,
they gathered it, and have made profit from it. The past year of six hundred and two, some natives found in the island of
Sebu a good-sized piece of ambergris, and when their encomendero heard of it, he took it, and traded with them secretly for
it, on the account of their tribute. It is said that it weighed a good number of libras. Afterward he brought it out and sold
it by the ounce at a higher rate.<a id="d0e1854src" href="#d0e1854" class="noteref">117</a>

</p>
<p>In the province and river of Butuan&#8212;which is pacified and assigned to Spaniards, and is located in the island of Mindanao&#8212;the
natives practice another industry, which is very useful. As they possess many civet cats, although smaller than those of Guinea,
they make use of the civet and trade it. This they do easily, for, when the moon is in the crescent, they hunt the cats with
nets, and capture many of them. Then when they have obtained the civet, they loose the cats. They also capture and cage some
of them, which are sold in the islands at very low prices.<a id="d0e1862src" href="#d0e1862" class="noteref">118</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e1869"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1869">106</a>]</span>Cotton is raised abundantly throughout the islands. It is spun and sold in the skein to the Chinese and other nations, who
come to get it. Cloth of different patterns is also woven from it, and the natives also trade that. Other cloths, called medri&ntilde;aques,
are woven from the banana leaf.<a id="d0e1871src" href="#d0e1871" class="noteref">119</a>

</p>
<p>The islands of Babuytanes<a id="d0e1885src" href="#d0e1885" class="noteref">120</a> consist of many small islands lying off the upper coast of the province of Cagayan. They are inhabited by natives, whose
chief industry consists in going to Cagayan, in their tapaques, with swine, fowls, and other food, and ebony spears, for exchange.
The islands are not assigned as encomiendas, nor is any tribute collected from them. There are no Spaniards among them, as
those natives are of less understanding and less civilized [than the others]. Accordingly no Christians have been made among
them, and they have no justices.

</p>
<p>Other islands, called the Catenduanes, lie off the other head of the island of Luzon, opposite the province of Camarines,
in fourteen degrees of north latitude, near the strait of Espiritu Santo. They are islands densely populated with natives
of good disposition, who are all assigned to Spaniards. They possess instruction and churches, and have an alcalde-mayor who
administers justice to them. Most of them cultivate the soil, but some are engaged in gold-washing, and in trading between
various islands, and with the mainland of Luzon, very near those islands.<a id="d0e1896src" href="#d0e1896" class="noteref">121</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e1911"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1911">107</a>]</span>The island of Luzon has a bay thirty leguas in circumference on its southern coast, situated about one hundred leguas from
the cape of Espiritu Santo, which is the entrance to the Capul channel. Its entrance is narrow, and midway contains an island
called Miraveles [<i>i.e.</i>, Corregidor] lying obliquely across it, which makes the entrance narrow. This island is about two leguas long and one-half
legua wide. It is high land and well shaded by its many trees. It contains a native settlement of fifty persons, and there
the watchman of the bay has his fixed abode and residence. There are channels at both ends of the island, where one may enter
the bay. The one at the south is one-half legua wide, and has a rock in its middle called El Fraile [&#8220;the friar&#8221;]. The one
on the north is much narrower, but any ships of any <a id="d0e1916"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1916">108</a>]</span>draft whatever can enter and go out by both channels. The entire bay is of good depth, and clean, and has good anchorages
in all parts. It is eight leguas from these entrances to the colony of Manila and the bar of the river. A large harbor is
formed two leguas south of Manila, with a point of land that shelters it. That point has a native settlement called Cabit,
<a id="d0e1918src" href="#d0e1918" class="noteref">122</a> and it gives name to the harbor, which is used as a port for the vessels. It is very capacious and well sheltered from the
vendavals&#8212;whether the southeast, and southwest, the west, and west-southwest, or the north-northeast and north winds. It has
a good anchorage, with a clean and good bottom. There is a good entrance quite near the land, more than one and one-half leguas
wide, for the ingress and egress of vessels. All the shores of this bay are well provided with abundant fisheries, of all
kinds. They are densely inhabited by natives. Above Manila there is a province of more than twenty leguas in extent called
La Pampanga. This province possesses many rivers and creeks that irrigate it. They all flow and empty into the bay. This province
contains many settlements of natives, and considerable quantities of rice, fruits, fish, meat, and other foods. <a id="d0e1927src" href="#d0e1927" class="noteref">123</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e1934"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1934">109</a>]</span>The bar of the river of Manila, which is in the same bay, near the colony of Manila on one side and Tondo on the other, is
not very deep because of certain sand shoals on it, which change their position at the time of the freshets and obstruct it.
Consequently, although the water is deep enough for any vessel past the bar, still, unless they are fragatas, vireys, or other
small vessels, they cannot pass the bar to enter the river. In respect to galleys, galliots, and the vessels from China, which
draw but little water, they must enter empty, and at high tide, and by towing. Such vessels anchor in the bay outside the
bar, and, for greater security enter the port of Cabit.

</p>
<p>There is another good port called Ybalon,<a id="d0e1938src" href="#d0e1938" class="noteref">124</a> twenty leguas from the channel of the same island of Luzon, which is sheltered from the vendavals, and has a good entrance
and anchorage. There the vessels that enter to escape the vendaval find shelter, and wait until the brisa returns, by which
to go to Manila, eighty leguas away.

</p>
<p>On the coasts of Pangasinan, Ylocos, and Cagayan, there are some ports and bars, where ships can enter and remain, such as
the harbor of Marihuma,<a id="d0e1946src" href="#d0e1946" class="noteref">125</a> the port El Frayle [&#8220;the friar&#8221;],<a id="d0e1952src" href="#d0e1952" class="noteref">126</a> that of Bolinao, the bar of Pangasinan, that of Bigan, the bar of Camalayuga, at the mouth of the Tajo River (which goes
up two leguas to the chief settlement of Cagayan)&#8212;besides other rivers, bars, harbors, and shelters of less account for smaller
vessels throughout the coasts of this island.

</p>
<p>Quite near this large island of Luzon, many other <a id="d0e1960"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1960">110</a>]</span>islands, large and small, are located; they are inhabited by the same natives as Luzon, who have gold placers, sowed fields,
and their trading. Such are Marinduque, Tablas Island, Mazbate, Burias, Banton, Bantonillo, and others of less importance.
The nearest of them to Manila is the island of Mindoro. It is more than eighty leguas long and about two hundred in circumference.
It has many settlements of the same natives, and the side lying next the provinces of Balayan and Calilaya is so near and
close to the island of Luzon, that it forms a strait which contains powerful currents and races, through which the ships going
to and from Manila enter and leave. The winds and currents there are very strong. It is about one-half a legua wide. In that
part is the chief town of this island of Mindoro. It has a port that is called El Varadero [&#8220;the place for laying up ships&#8221;]
for large vessels. There are also other anchorages and bars throughout this island for smaller vessels; and many settlements
and natives on all the coasts of this island. All of the settlements abound in rice, food, and gold-placers, and all kinds
of game and timber.<a id="d0e1962src" href="#d0e1962" class="noteref">127</a>

</p>
<p>The cape of Espiritu Santo, which is sighted by ships entering the Filipinas Islands on the way from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, is in an
island called Tendaya,<a id="d0e1970src" href="#d0e1970" class="noteref">128</a> in <a id="d0e1976"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1976">111</a>]</span>about thirteen degrees. Twenty leguas south after turning this cape of Espiritu Santo lie the island of Viri, and many others
which are sighted. Through them an entrance opens to the island of Sebu by a strait called San Juanillo, which is formed by
these islands. It is not very good or safe for the larger ships. But toward the north after leaving this course, one reaches
the island of Capul, which forms a strait and channel of many currents and rough waves, through which the ships enter. Before
reaching the strait there is a rock, or barren islet, called San Bernardino; this strait is formed by the coast of the island
of Luzon and that of the island of Capul. Its channel is about one legua long and less wide.

</p>
<p>On leaving this strait, after having entered by it, three small islets form a triangle. They are called the islands of Naranjos
[&#8220;Oranges&#8221;], and are lofty and inaccessible with steep rocks. Upon them ships are wont to be driven by the powerful currents,
even though they try to escape them. These are not inhabited, but the others [Capul, Viri, etc.] are large islands containing
many settlements of natives and all kinds of provisions and food.

</p>
<p>South of this district lie the islands of Bi&ccedil;ayas, or, as they are also called, Pintados. They are many in number, thickly
populated with natives. Those of most renown are Leite, Ybabao,<a id="d0e1982src" href="#d0e1982" class="noteref">129</a> Camar [Samar], Bohol, island of Negros, Sebu, Panay, Cuyo, and the Calamianes. All the natives of these islands, both men
and women, are well-featured, of a good disposition, and of better nature, and more noble in their actions than the inhabitants
of the islands of Luzon and its vicinity.

</p>
<p><a id="d0e1989"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e1989">112</a>]</span>They differ from them in their hair, which the men wear cut in a cue, like the ancient style in Espa&ntilde;a. Their bodies are tattooed
with many designs, but the face is not touched.<a id="d0e1991src" href="#d0e1991" class="noteref">130</a> They wear large earrings of gold and ivory in their ears, and bracelets of the same; certain scarfs wrapped round the head,
very showy, which resemble turbans, and knotted very gracefully and edged with gold. They wear also a loose collarless jacket
with tight sleeves, whose skirts reach half way down the leg. These garments are fastened in front and are made of medri&ntilde;aque
and colored silks. They wear no shirts or drawers, but bahaques [<i>i.e.</i>, breech-clouts] of many wrappings, which cover their privy parts, when they remove their skirts and jackets. The women are
good-looking and graceful. They are very neat, and walk slowly. Their hair is black, long, and drawn into a knot on the head.
Their robes are wrapped about the waist and fall downward. These are made of all colors, and they wear collarless jackets
of the same material. Both men and women go naked and without any coverings,<a id="d0e2006src" href="#d0e2006" class="noteref">131</a> and barefoot, and with <a id="d0e2017"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2017">113</a>]</span>many gold chains, earrings, and wrought bracelets.

</p>
<p>Their weapons consist of large knives curved like cutlasses, spears, and cara&ccedil;as [<i>i.e.</i>, shields]. They employ the same kinds of boats as the inhabitants of Luzon. They have the same occupations, products, and
means of gain as the inhabitants of all the other islands. These Visayans are a race less inclined to agriculture, and are
skilful in navigation, and eager for war and raids for pillage and booty, which they call <i>mangubas</i>.<a id="d0e2027src" href="#d0e2027" class="noteref">132</a> This means &#8220;to go out for plunder.&#8221;

</p>
<p>Near the principal settlement of the island of Sebu, there is a fine port for all manner of vessels. It has a good entrance
and furnishes shelter at all times. It has a good bottom and is an excellent anchorage. There are also other ports and bars
of less importance and consideration, as in all these islands, for smaller vessels.

</p>
<p>This island of Sebu is an island of more than one hundred leguas in circumference. It has abundance of provisions, and gold
mines and placers, and is inhabited by natives.

</p>
<p>Beyond it lie other islands, very pleasant and well populated, especially the island of Panay. Panay is a large island, more
than one hundred leguas in circumference, containing many native settlements.<a id="d0e2044src" href="#d0e2044" class="noteref">133</a> It <a id="d0e2052"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2052">114</a>]</span>produces considerable quantities of rice, palm-wine, and all manner of provisions. It has flourishing and wealthy settlements,
on what is called the river of Panay. The chief one is Oton, which has a bar and port for galleys and ships, shipyards for
building large ships, and a great amount of timber for their construction. There are many natives, who are masters of all
kinds of shipbuilding. Near this island lies an islet eight leguas in circumference, which is densely populated by natives
who are all carpenters. They are excellent workmen, and practice no other trade or occupation; and, without a single tree
of any size on this whole islet, they practice this art with great ability. From there all the islands are furnished with
workmen for carpentry. The island is called that of the Cagayanes.

</p>
<p>After the island of Sebu follow immediately the island of Mindanao, an island of more than three hundred leguas in circumference,
and Jol&oacute;, which is small. Lower down is the island of Borneo, a very large island, more than five hundred leguas in circumference.
All of these islands are densely populated, although that of Borneo is not subdued. Neither is that of Mindanao in entirety,
but only the river of Botuan, Dapitan, and the province and coast of Caragan.

</p>
<p>Below this island [Mindanao], before reaching that of Borneo, lie the islands of the Calamianes. <a id="d0e2058"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2058">115</a>]</span>They are very numerous, and consist of islands of various sizes, which are densely inhabited with natives; they have some
supply of provisions and engage in certain kinds of husbandry. However the most usual occupation is that of their navigations
from island to island in pursuit of their trading and exchange, and their fisheries; while those who live nearest the island
of Borneo are wont to go on piratical raids and pillage the natives in other islands.

</p>
<p>The flow- and ebb-tides, and the high and low tides among these islands are so diverse in them that they have no fixed rule,
either because of the powerful currents among these islands, or by some other natural secret of the flux and reflux which
the moon causes. No definite knowledge has been arrived at in this regard, for although the tides are highest during the opposition
of the moon, and are higher in the month of March than throughout the rest of the year, there is so great variation in the
daily tides that it causes surprise. Some days there are two equal tides between day and night, while other days there is
but one. At other times the flow during the day is low, and that of the night greater. They usually have no fixed hour, for
it may happen to be high-tide one day at noon, while next day high-tide may be anticipated or postponed many hours. Or the
tide of one day may be low, and when a smaller one is expected for next day, it may be much greater.

</p>
<p>The language of all the Pintados and Bi&ccedil;ayas is one and the same, by which they understand one another when talking, or when
writing with the letters and characters of their own which they possess. These resemble those of the Arabs. The common manner
of writing among the natives is on leaves of trees, and <a id="d0e2064"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2064">116</a>]</span>on bamboo bark. Throughout the islands the bamboo is abundant; it has huge and misshapen joints, and lower part is a very
thick and solid tree.<a id="d0e2066src" href="#d0e2066" class="noteref">134</a>

</p>
<p>The language of Luzon and those islands in its vicinity differs widely from that of the Bicayas.<a id="d0e2076src" href="#d0e2076" class="noteref">135</a> The language of the island of Luzon is not uniform, for the Cagayans have one language and the Ylocos another. The Zambales
have their own particular language, while the Pampangos also have one different from the others. The inhabitants of the province
of Manila, the Tag&aacute;ls, have their own language, which is very rich and copious. By means of it one can express elegantly whatever
he wishes, and in many modes and manners. It is not difficult, either to learn or to pronounce.

</p>
<p>The natives throughout the islands can write excellently with certain characters, almost like the Greek or Arabic. These characters
are fifteen in all. Three are vowels, which are used as are our five. The consonants number twelve, and each and all of them
combine with certain dots or commas, and so signify whatever one wishes to write, as fluently and easily as is done with our
Spanish alphabet. The method of writing was on bamboo, but is now on paper, commencing the lines at the right and running
to the left, in the Arabic fashion. Almost all the <a id="d0e2084"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2084">117</a>]</span>natives, both men and women, write in this language. There are very few who do not write it excellently and correctly.

</p>
<p>This language of the province of Manila [<i>i.e.</i>, the Tag&aacute;l] extends throughout the province of Camarines, and other islands not contiguous to Luzon. There is but little
difference in that spoken in the various districts, except that it is spoken more elegantly in some provinces than in others.<a id="d0e2091src" href="#d0e2091" class="noteref">136</a>

</p>
<p>The edifices and houses of the natives of all these Filipinas Islands are built in a uniform manner, as are their settlements;
for they always build them on the shores of the sea, between rivers and creeks. The natives generally gather in districts
or settlements where they sow their rice, and possess their palm trees, nipa and banana groves, and other trees, and implements
for their fishing and sailing. A small number inhabit the interior, and are called tinguianes; they also seek sites on rivers
and creeks, on which they settle for the same reasons.

</p>
<p>The houses and dwellings of all these natives are universally set upon stakes and <i>arigues</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, columns] high above the ground. Their rooms are <a id="d0e2113"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2113">118</a>]</span>small and the roofs low. They are built and tiled with wood and bamboos,<a id="d0e2115src" href="#d0e2115" class="noteref">137</a> and covered and roofed with nipa-palm leaves. Each house is separate, and is not built adjoining another. In the lower part
are enclosures made by stakes and bamboos, where their fowls and cattle are reared, and the rice pounded and cleaned. One
ascends into the houses by means of ladders that can be drawn up, which are made from two bamboos. Above are their open <i>batalanes</i> [galleries] used for household duties; the parents and [grown] children live together. There is little adornment and finery
in the houses, which are called <i>bahandin</i>.<a id="d0e2124src" href="#d0e2124" class="noteref">138</a>

</p>
<p>Besides these houses, which are those of the common people and those of less importance, there are the chiefs&#8217; houses. They
are built upon trees and thick arigues, with many rooms and comforts. They are well constructed of timber and planks, and
are strong and large. They are furnished and supplied with all that is necessary, and are much finer and more substantial
than the others. They are roofed, however, as are the others, with the palm-leaves called nipa. These keep out the water and
the sun more than do shingles or tiles, although the danger from fires is greater.

</p>
<p>The natives do not inhabit the lower part of their houses, because they raise their fowls and cattle there, and because of
the damp and heat of the earth, and the many rats, which are enormous and destructive both in the houses and sowed fields;
and because, <a id="d0e2143"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2143">119</a>]</span>as their houses are generally built on the sea shore, or on the banks of rivers and creeks, the waters bathe the lower parts,
and the latter are consequently left open.

</p>
<p>There were no kings or lords throughout these islands who ruled over them as in the manner of our kingdoms and provinces;
but in every island, and in each province of it, many chiefs were recognized by the natives themselves. Some were more powerful
than others, and each one had his followers and subjects, by districts and families; and these obeyed and respected the chief.
Some chiefs had friendship and communication with others, and at times wars and quarrels.<a id="d0e2147src" href="#d0e2147" class="noteref">139</a>

</p>
<p>These principalities and lordships were inherited in the male line and by succession of father and son and their descendants.
If these were lacking, then their brothers and collateral relatives succeeded. Their duty was to rule and govern their subjects
and followers, and to assist them in their interests and necessities. What the chiefs received from their followers was to
be held by them in great veneration and respect; and they were served in their wars and voyages, and in their tilling, sowing,
fishing, and the building of their houses. To these duties the natives attended very promptly, whenever summoned by their
chief. They also paid the chiefs tribute (which they called <i>buiz</i>), in varying quantities, in the crops that they gathered. The descendants of such chiefs, and their relatives, even though
they did not inherit the lordship, were held in the same respect and consideration. Such were all regarded as nobles, <a id="d0e2161"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2161">120</a>]</span>and as persons exempt from the services rendered by the others, or the plebeians, who were called <i>timaguas</i>.<a id="d0e2166src" href="#d0e2166" class="noteref">140</a> The same right of nobility and chieftainship was preserved for the women, just as for the men. When any of these chiefs was
more courageous than others in war and upon other occasions, such a one enjoyed more followers and men; and the others were
under his leadership, even if they were chiefs. These latter retained to themselves the lordship and particular government
of their own following, which is called <i>barangai</i> among them. They had <i>datos</i> and other special leaders [<i>mandadores</i>] who attended to the interests of the barangay.

</p>
<p>The superiority of these chiefs over those of their barangai was so great that they held the latter as subjects; they treated
these well or ill, and disposed of their persons, their children, and their possessions, at will, without any resistance,
or rendering account to anyone. For very slight annoyances and for slight occasions, they were wont to kill and wound them,
and to enslave them. It has happened that the chiefs have made perpetual slaves of persons who have gone by them, while bathing
in the river, or who have raised their eyes to look at them less respectfully and for other similar causes.<a id="d0e2183src" href="#d0e2183" class="noteref">141</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e2192"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2192">121</a>]</span>When some natives had suits or disputes with others over matters of property and interest, or over personal injuries and wrongs
received, they appointed old men of the same district, to try them, the parties being present. If they had to present proofs,
they brought their witnesses there, and the case was immediately judged according to what was found, according to the usages
of their ancestors on like occasions; and that sentence was observed and executed without any further objection or delay.<a id="d0e2194src" href="#d0e2194" class="noteref">142</a>

</p>
<p>The natives&#8217; laws throughout the islands were made in the same manner, and they followed the traditions and customs of their
ancestors, without anything being written. Some provinces had different customs than others in some respects. However, they
agreed in most, and in all the islands generally the same usages were followed.<a id="d0e2199src" href="#d0e2199" class="noteref">143</a>

</p>
<p>There are three conditions of persons among the natives of these islands, and into which their government is divided: the
chiefs, of whom we have already treated; the timaguas, who are equivalent to plebeians; and slaves, those of both chiefs and
timaguas.

</p>
<p>The slaves were of several classes. Some were <a id="d0e2209"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2209">122</a>]</span>for all kinds of work and slavery, like those which we ourselves hold. Such are called <i>saguiguilires</i>;<a id="d0e2214src" href="#d0e2214" class="noteref">144</a> they served inside the house, as did likewise the children born of them. There are others who live in their own houses with
their families, outside the house of their lord; and come, at the season, to aid him in his sowings and harvests, among his
rowers when he embarks, in the construction of his house when it is being built, and to serve in his house when there are
guests of distinction. These are bound to come to their lord&#8217;s house whenever he summons them, and to serve in these offices
without any pay or stipend. These slaves are called <i>namamahays</i>,<a id="d0e2265src" href="#d0e2265" class="noteref">145</a> and their children and descendants are slaves of the same class. From these slaves&#8212;<i>saguiguilirs</i> and <i>namamahays</i>&#8212;are issue, some of whom are whole slaves, some of whom are half slaves, and still others one-fourth slaves. It happens thus:
if either the <a id="d0e2288"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2288">123</a>]</span>father or the mother was free, and they had an only child, he was half free and half slave. If they had more than one child,
they were divided as follows: the first follows the condition of the father, free or slave; the second that of the mother.
If there were an odd number of children, the last was half free and half slave. Those who descended from these, if children
of a free mother or father, were only one-fourth slaves, because of being children of a free father or mother and of a half-slave.
These half slaves or one-fourth slaves, whether saguiguilirs or namamahays, served their masters during every other moon;
and in this respect so is such condition slavery.

</p>
<p>In the same way, it may happen in divisions between heirs that a slave will fall to several, and serves each one for the time
that is due him. When the slave is not wholly slave, but half or fourth, he has the right, because of that part that is free,
to compel his master to emancipate him for a just price. This price is appraised and regulated for persons according to the
quality of their slavery, whether it be saguiguilir or namamahay, half slave or quarter slave. But, if he is wholly slave,
the master cannot be compelled to ransom or emancipate him for any price.

</p>
<p>The usual price of a sanguiguilir slave among the natives is, at most, generally ten taes of good gold, or eighty pesos; if
he is namamahay, half of that sum. The others are in the same proportion, taking into consideration the person and his age.

</p>
<p>No fixed beginning can be assigned as the origin of these kinds of slavery among these natives, because all the slaves are
natives of the islands, and not strangers. It is thought that they were made in their wars and quarrels. The most certain
knowledge is <a id="d0e2296"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2296">124</a>]</span>that the most powerful made the others slaves, and seized them for slight cause or occasion, and many times for loans and
usurious contracts which were current among them. The interest, capital, and debt, increased so much with delay that the borrowers
became slaves. Consequently all these slaveries have violent and unjust beginnings; and most of the suits among the natives
are over these, and they occupy the judges in the exterior court with them, and their confessors in that of conscience. <a id="d0e2298src" href="#d0e2298" class="noteref">146</a>

</p>
<p>These slaves comprise the greatest wealth and capital of the natives of these islands, for they are very useful to them and
necessary for the cultivation of their property. They are sold, traded, and exchanged among them, just as any other mercantile
article, from one village to another, from one province to another, and likewise from one island to another. Therefore, and
to avoid so many suits as would occur if these slaveries were examined, and their origin and source ascertained, they are
preserved and held as they were formerly.

</p>
<p>The marriages of these natives, commonly and generally were, and are: Chiefs with women chiefs; timaguas with those of that
rank; and slaves with <a id="d0e2308"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2308">125</a>]</span>those of their own class. But sometimes these classes intermarry with one another. They considered one woman, whom they married,
as the legitimate wife and the mistress of the house; and she was styled <i>ynasaba</i>.<a id="d0e2313src" href="#d0e2313" class="noteref">147</a> Those whom they kept besides her they considered as friends. The children of the first were regarded as legitimate and whole
heirs of their parents; the <span class="corr" title="Source: chilren">children</span> of the others were not so regarded, and were left something by assignment, but they did not inherit.

</p>
<p>The dowry was furnished by the man, being given by his parents. The wife furnished nothing for the marriage, until she had
inherited it from her parents. The solemnity of the marriage consisted in nothing more than the agreement between the parents
and relatives of the contracting parties, the payment of the dowry agreed upon to the father of the bride,<a id="d0e2329src" href="#d0e2329" class="noteref">148</a> and the assembling at the wife&#8217;s parents&#8217; house of all the relatives to eat and drink until they would fall down. At night
the man took the woman to his house and into his power, and there she remained. These marriages were annulled and dissolved
for slight cause, with the examination and judgment of the relatives of both parties, and of the old men, who acted as mediators
in the affairs. At such a time the man took the dowry <a id="d0e2335"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2335">126</a>]</span>(which they call <i>vigadicaya</i>),<a id="d0e2340src" href="#d0e2340" class="noteref">149</a> unless it happened that they separated through the husband&#8217;s fault; for then it was not returned to him, and the wife&#8217;s parents
kept it. The property that they had acquired together was divided into halves, and each one disposed of his own. If one made
any profits in which the other did not have a share or participate, he acquired it for himself alone.

</p>
<p>The Indians were adopted one by another, in presence of the relatives. The adopted person gave and delivered all his actual
possessions to the one who adopted him. Thereupon he remained in his house and care, and had a right to inherit with the other
children.<a id="d0e2353src" href="#d0e2353" class="noteref">150</a>

</p>
<p>Adulteries were not punishable corporally. If the adulterer paid the aggrieved party the amount adjudged by the old men and
agreed upon by them, then the injury was pardoned, and the husband was appeased and retained his honor. He would still live
with his wife and there would be no further talk about the matter.

</p>
<p>In inheritances all the legitimate children inherited equally from their parents whatever property they had acquired. If there
were any movable or landed property which they had received from their parents, such went to the nearest relatives and <a id="d0e2363"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2363">127</a>]</span>the collateral side of that stock, if there were no legitimate children by an ynasaba. This was the case either with or without
a will. In the act of drawing a will, there was no further ceremony than to have written it or to have stated it orally before
acquaintances.

</p>
<p>If any chief was lord of a barangai, then in that case, the eldest son of an ynasaba succeeded him. If he died, the second
son succeeded. If there were no sons, then the daughters succeeded in the same order. If there were no legitimate successors,
the succession went to the nearest relative belonging to the lineage and relationship of the chief who had been the last possessor
of it.

</p>
<p>If any native who had slave women made concubines of any of them, and such slave woman had children, those children were free,
as was the slave. But if she had no children, she remained a slave.<a id="d0e2369src" href="#d0e2369" class="noteref">151</a>

</p>
<p>These children by a slave woman, and those borne by a married woman, were regarded as illegitimate, and did not succeed to
the inheritance with the other children, neither were the parents obliged to leave them anything. Even if they were the sons
of chiefs, they did not succeed to the nobility or chieftainship of the parents, nor to their privileges, but they remained
and were reckoned as plebeians and in the number and rank of the other timaguas.

</p>
<p>The contracts and negotiations of these natives were generally illegal, each one paying attention to how he might better his
own business and interest.

</p>
<p>Loans with interest were very common and much <a id="d0e2381"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2381">128</a>]</span>practiced, and the interest incurred was excessive. The debt doubled and increased all the time while payment was delayed,
until it stripped the debtor of all his possessions, and he and his children, when all their property was gone, became slaves.<a id="d0e2383src" href="#d0e2383" class="noteref">152</a>

</p>
<p>Their customary method of trading was by bartering one thing for another, such as food, cloth, cattle, fowls, lands, houses,
fields, slaves, fishing-grounds, and palm-trees (both nipa and wild). Sometimes a price intervened, which was paid in gold,
as agreed upon, or in metal bells brought from China. These bells they regard as precious jewels; they resemble large pans
and are very sonorous.<a id="d0e2394src" href="#d0e2394" class="noteref">153</a> They play upon these at their feasts, and carry them to the war in their boats instead of drums and other instruments. There
are often delays and terms for certain payments, and bondsmen who intervene and bind themselves, but always with very usurious
and excessive profits and interests.

</p>
<p>Crimes were punished by request of the aggrieved parties. Especially were thefts punished with greater severity, the robbers
being enslaved or sometimes put to death.<a id="d0e2408src" href="#d0e2408" class="noteref">154</a> The same was true of insulting <a id="d0e2416"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2416">129</a>]</span>words, especially when spoken to chiefs. They had among themselves many expressions and words which they regarded as the highest
insult, when said to men and women. These were pardoned less willingly and with greater difficulty than was personal violence,
such as wounding and assaulting.<a id="d0e2418src" href="#d0e2418" class="noteref">155</a>

</p>
<p>Concubinage, rape, and incest, were not regarded at all, unless committed by a timagua on the person of a woman chief. It
was a quite ordinary practice for a married man to have lived a long time in concubinage with the sister of his wife. Even
before having communication with his wife he could have had access for a long time to his mother-in-law, especially if the
bride were very young, and until she were of sufficient age. This was done in sight of all the relatives.

</p>
<p>Single men are called <i>bagontaos</i>,<a id="d0e2431src" href="#d0e2431" class="noteref">156</a> and girls of marriageable age, <i>dalagas</i>. Both classes are people of little restraint, and from early childhood they have communication with one another, and mingle
with facility and little secrecy, and without this being regarded among the natives as a cause for anger. Neither do the parents,
brothers, or relatives, show any anger, especially if there is any material interest in it, and but little is sufficient with
each and all.

</p>
<p><a id="d0e2447"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2447">130</a>]</span>As long as these natives lived in their paganism, it was not known that they had fallen into the abominable sin against nature.
But after the Spaniards had entered their country, through communication with them&#8212;and still more, through that with the Sangleys,
who have come from China, and are much given to that vice&#8212;it has been communicated to them somewhat, both to men and to women.
In this matter it has been necessary to take action.

</p>
<p>The natives of the islands of Pintados, especially the women, are very vicious and sensual. Their perverseness has discovered
lascivious methods of communication between men and women; and there is one to which they are accustomed from their youth.
The men skilfully make a hole in their virile member near its head, and insert therein a serpent&#8217;s head, either of metal or
ivory, and fasten it with a peg of the same material passed through the hole, so that it cannot become unfastened. With this
device, they have communication with their wives, and are unable to withdraw until a long time after copulation. They are
very fond of this and receive much pleasure from it, so that, although they shed a quantity of blood, and receive other harm,
it is current among them. These devices are called <i>sagras,</i> and there are very few of them, because since they have become Christians, strenuous efforts are being made to do away with
these, and not consent to their use; and consequently the practice has been checked in great part.<a id="d0e2454src" href="#d0e2454" class="noteref">157</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e2467"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2467">131</a>]</span>Herbalists and witches are common among these natives, but are not punished or prohibited among them, so long as they do not
cause any special harm. But seldom could that be ascertained or known.

</p>
<p>There were also men whose business was to ravish and take away virginity from young girls. These girls were taken to such
men, and the latter were paid for ravishing them, for the natives considered it a hindrance and impediment if the girls were
virgins when they married.

</p>
<p>In matters of religion, the natives proceeded more barbarously and with greater blindness than in all the rest. For besides
being pagans, without any knowledge of the true God, they neither strove to discover Him by way of reason, nor had any fixed
belief. The devil usually deceived them with a thousand errors and blindnesses. He appeared to them in various horrible and
frightful forms, and as fierce animals, so that they feared him and trembled before him. They generally worshiped him, and
made images of him in the said forms. These they kept in caves and private houses, where they offered them perfumes and odors,
and food and fruit, calling them <i>anitos</i>.<a id="d0e2476src" href="#d0e2476" class="noteref">158</a>

</p>
<p>Others worshiped the sun and the moon, and made feasts and drunken revels at the conjunction of those bodies. Some worshiped
a yellow-colored bird that dwells in their woods, called <i>batala</i>. They generally worship and adore the crocodiles when they see them, by kneeling down and clasping their hands, because of
the harm that they receive from those <a id="d0e2493"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2493">132</a>]</span>reptiles; they believe that by so doing the crocodiles will become appeased and leave them. Their oaths, execrations, and
promises are all as above mentioned, namely, &#8220;May <i>buhayan</i> eat thee, if thou dost not speak truth, or fulfil what thou hast promised,&#8221; and similar things.

</p>
<p>There were no temples throughout those islands, nor houses generally used for the worship of idols; but each person possessed
and made in his house his own <i>anitos</i>,<a id="d0e2503src" href="#d0e2503" class="noteref">159</a> without any fixed rite or ceremony. They had no priests or religious to attend to religious affairs, except certain old men
and women called <i>catalonas</i>. These were experienced witches and sorcerers, who kept the other people deceived. The latter <span class="corr" title="Source: communicatd">communicated</span> to these sorcerers their desires and needs, and the catalonas told them innumerable extravagancies and lies. The catalonas
uttered prayers and performed other ceremonies to the idols for the sick; and they believed in omens and superstitions, with
which the devil inspired them, whereby they declared whether the patient would recover or die. Such were their cures and methods,
and they used various kinds of divinations for all things. All this was with so little aid, apparatus, or foundation&#8212;which
God permitted, so that the preaching of the holy gospel should find those of that region better prepared for it, and so that
those natives would confess the truth more easily, and it would be less difficult to withdraw them from their darkness, and
<a id="d0e2524"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2524">133</a>]</span>the errors in which the devil kept them for so many years. They never sacrificed human beings as is done in other kingdoms.
They believed that there was a future life where those who had been brave and performed valiant feats would be rewarded; while
those who had done evil would be punished. But they did not know how or where this would be.<a id="d0e2526src" href="#d0e2526" class="noteref">160</a>

</p>
<p>They buried their dead in their own houses, and kept their bodies and bones for a long time in chests. They venerated the
skulls of the dead as if they were living and present. Their funeral rites did not consist of pomp or assemblages, beyond
those of their own house&#8212;where, after bewailing the dead, all was changed into feasting and drunken revelry among all the
relatives and friends.<a id="d0e2543src" href="#d0e2543" class="noteref">161</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e2558"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2558">134</a>]</span>A few years before the Spaniards subdued the island of Luzon, certain natives of the island of Borneo began to go thither
to trade, especially to the settlement of Manila and Tondo; and the inhabitants of the one island intermarried with those
of the other. These Borneans are Mahometans, and were already introducing their religion among the natives of Luzon, and were
giving them instructions, ceremonies, and the form of observing their religion, by means of certain <i>gazizes</i><a id="d0e2562src" href="#d0e2562" class="noteref">162</a> whom they brought with them. Already a considerable number, and those the chiefest men, were commencing, although by piecemeal,
to become Moros, and were being circumcised<a id="d0e2570src" href="#d0e2570" class="noteref">163</a> and taking the names of Moros. Had <a id="d0e2596"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2596">135</a>]</span>the Spaniards&#8217; coming been delayed longer, that religion would have spread throughout the island, and even through the others,
and it would have been difficult to extirpate it. The mercy of God checked it in time; for, because of being in so early stages,
it was uprooted from the islands, and they were freed from it, that is, in all that the Spaniards have pacified, and that
are under the government of the Filipinas. That religion has spread and extended very widely in the other islands outside
of this government, so that now almost all of their natives are Mahometan Moros, and are ruled and instructed by their <i>ga&ccedil;izes</i> and other <i>morabitos</i>;<a id="d0e2604src" href="#d0e2604" class="noteref">164</a> these often come to preach to and teach them by way of the strait of Ma[la]ca and the Red Sea, through which they navigate
to reach these islands.

</p>
<p>The arrival of the Spaniards in these Filipinas Islands, since the year one thousand five hundred and sixty-four, the pacification
and conversion that has been made therein, their mode of governing, and the provisions of his Majesty during these years for
their welfare, have caused innovations in many things, such as are usual to kingdoms and provinces that change their religion
and sovereign. The foremost has been that, besides the name of Filipinas which all the islands took and received from the
beginning of their conquest, they belong to a new kingdom and seigniory to which his Majesty, Filipo <a id="d0e2609"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2609">136</a>]</span>Second, our sovereign, gave the name of Nuevo Reyno de Castilla [&#8220;New Kingdom of Castilla&#8221;]. By his royal concession, he made
the city of Manila capital of it, and gave to it as a special favor, among other things, a crowned coat-of-arms which was
chosen and assigned by his royal person. This is an escutcheon divided across. In the upper part is a castle on a red field,
and in the lower a lion of gold, crowned and rampant, holding a naked sword in its right paw. One-half of the body is in the
form of a dolphin upon the waters of the sea, to signify that the Spaniards crossed the sea with their arms to conquer this
kingdom for the crown of Castilla.<a id="d0e2611src" href="#d0e2611" class="noteref">165</a>

</p>
<p>The city of Manila was founded by the adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, first governor of the Filipinas, in the island of
Luzon. It occupies the same site where Rajamora had his settlement and fort&#8212;as has been related more at length&#8212;at the mouth
of the river which empties into the bay, on a point between the river and the sea. The whole site was occupied by this new
settlement, and Legazpi apportioned it to the Spaniards in equal building-lots. It was laid out with well-arranged streets
and squares, straight and level. A sufficiently large main square [<i>Plaza mayor</i>] was left, fronting which were erected the cathedral church and municipal buildings. He left another square, that of arms
[<i>Plaza de armas</i>], fronting which was built the fort, as well as the royal buildings. He gave sites for the monasteries,<a id="d0e2625src" href="#d0e2625" class="noteref">166</a> hospital, and chapels which were to be built, as being a city which was to grow and increase continually&#8212;<a id="d0e2631"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2631">137</a>]</span>as already it has done; for, in the course of the time that has passed, that city has flourished as much as the best of all
the cities in those regions.

</p>
<p>The city is completely surrounded with a stone wall, which is more than two and one-half varas wide, and in places more than
three. It has small towers and traverses at intervals. <a id="d0e2635src" href="#d0e2635" class="noteref">167</a> It has a fortress of hewn stone at the point that guards the bar and the river, with a ravelin close to the water, upon which
are mounted some large pieces of artillery. This artillery commands the sea and river, while other pieces are mounted farther
up to defend the bar, besides some other moderate-sized field-pieces and swivel-guns. These fortifications have their vaults
for storing supplies and munitions, and a magazine for the powder, which is well guarded and situated in the inner part; and
a copious well of fresh water. There are also quarters for the soldiers and artillerymen, and the house of the commandant
[alcayde]. The city has been lately fortified on the land side at the Plaza de armas, where it is entered by a strong wall
and two salient towers, defended with artillery, which command the wall and gate. This fortress is called Santiago, and has
a company of thirty soldiers with their officers, and eight artillerymen who guard the gate and entrance by watches&#8212;all in
charge of a commandant who lives inside, and has the guard and custody of the fort.

</p>
<p>There is another fortress, also of stone, in the same wall, within culverin range, located at the end<a id="d0e2643src" href="#d0e2643" class="noteref">168</a> of <a id="d0e2652"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2652">138</a>]</span>the curtain, which extends along the shore of the bay. It is called Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia, and is a very large round tower.
It has its own court, well, and quarters inside, as well as the magazine, and other rooms for work. It has a traverse extending
to the beach, on which are mounted a dozen large and moderate-sized pieces, which command the bay and sweep the wall, which
extends along the shore to the gate and to the fort of Santiago. On the other side the fortress has a large salient tower,
mounted with four large pieces, which command the shore ahead in the direction of the chapel of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia. The
gate and entrance is within the city and is guarded by a company of twenty soldiers and their officers, six artillerymen,
and one commandant and his lieutenant, who live inside.

</p>
<p>On the land side, where the wall extends, there is a rampart called Sant Andres, which mounts six pieces of artillery that
command in all directions, and some swivel-guns. Farther on is another traverse called San Gabriel, opposite the pari&aacute;n of
the Sangleys, with a like amount of artillery. Both have some soldiers and an ordinary guard.

</p>
<p>The wall has a sufficient height, and is furnished with battlements and turrets, built in the modern style, for its defense.
It has a circuit of about one legua, which can be made entirely on top. It has many broad steps of the same hewn stone, at
intervals inside. There are three principal city gates on the land side, and many other posterns opening at convenient places
on the river and beach, for the service of the city. Each and all of them are locked before nightfall by the ordinary patrols.
These carry the keys to the guard-room of the royal buildings. <a id="d0e2658"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2658">139</a>]</span>In the morning when day comes, the patrols return with the keys and open the city.<a id="d0e2660src" href="#d0e2660" class="noteref">169</a>

</p>
<p>The royal arsenals front on the Plaza de armas. In them are kept and guarded all the supplies of ammunition, food, rigging,
iron, copper, lead, artillery, arquebuses, and other things belonging to the royal estate. They have their own officers and
workmen, and are placed in charge of the royal officials.

</p>
<p>Near these arsenals is located the powder-house, with its master, workmen, and convicts, where powder is generally ground
in thirty mortars, and that which is spoiled is refined.<a id="d0e2670src" href="#d0e2670" class="noteref">170</a>

</p>
<p>The building for the founding of artillery is located on a suitable site in another part of the city. It has its molds, ovens,
and tools, founders, and workmen who work it.<a id="d0e2678src" href="#d0e2678" class="noteref">171</a>

</p>
<p>The royal buildings are very beautiful and <span class="corr" title="Source: slightly">sightly</span>, and contain many rooms. They have many windows opening toward the sea and the Plaza de armas. They are all built of stone
and have two courts, with upper and lower galleries raised on stout pillars. The governor and president lives inside with
his family. There is a hall for the royal Audiencia, which is very large and stately; also a <a id="d0e2689"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2689">140</a>]</span>separate chapel, a room for the royal seal,<a id="d0e2691src" href="#d0e2691" class="noteref">172</a> and offices for the scriveners of the Audiencia, and the government. There are also other apartments for the royal treasury
and the administration of the royal officials, while a large porch opens on the street with two principal doors, where the
guardroom is located. There is one company of regular arquebusiers, who come in daily with their banners to stand guard. Opposite,
on the other side of the street, is another edifice for the royal treasury and those in charge of it.<a id="d0e2697src" href="#d0e2697" class="noteref">173</a>

</p>
<p>The houses of the cabildo, located on the square, are built of stone. They are very sightly and have handsome halls. On the
ground floor is the prison, and the court of the alcaldes-in-ordinary.<a id="d0e2705src" href="#d0e2705" class="noteref">174</a>

</p>
<p>On the same square is situated the cathedral church. It is built of hewn stone, and has three naves, and its main chapel,
and choir, with high and low seats. The choir is shut in by railings, and has its organ, missal-stands, and other necessary
things. The cathedral has also its sacristan<a id="d0e2713src" href="#d0e2713" class="noteref">175</a> and his apartments and offices.

</p>
<p>Within the city is the monastery of St. Augustine. It is very large and has many dormitories, a refectory and kitchens. They
are now completing a church, which is one of the most sumptuous in those districts. This convent has generally fifty religious.<a id="d0e2724src" href="#d0e2724" class="noteref">176</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e2731"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2731">141</a>]</span>The monastery of St. Dominic is inside the walls. It contains about forty religious. It was built of stone, and was very well
constructed. It has a church, house, and all offices. It has lately been rebuilt, and much better; for it was completely destroyed
in the burning of the city in the year six hundred and three.

</p>
<p>The monastery of St. Francis is farther on. It is well constructed of stone, and its church is being rebuilt. It contains
about forty discalced religious.

</p>
<p>The residence [<i>colegio</i>] of the Society of Jesus is established near the fortress of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia. It contains twenty religious of their
order, and is an excellent stone house and church. There they study Latin, the arts, and cases of conscience. Connected with
them is a seminary and convictorio<a id="d0e2740src" href="#d0e2740" class="noteref">177</a> for Spanish scholars, with their rector. These students wear gowns of tawny-colored frieze with red facings.<a id="d0e2743src" href="#d0e2743" class="noteref">178</a>

</p>
<p>In another part of the city stands a handsome house, walled in, with its stone church, called San Andres and Santa Potenciana.
It is a royal foundation, and a rectoress lives there. It has a revolving entrance and a parlor, and the rectoress has other
<a id="d0e2751"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2751">142</a>]</span>confidential assistants; and there shelter is given to needy women and girls of the city, in the form of religious retirement.
Some of the girls leave the house to be married, while others remain there permanently. It has its own house for work, and
its choir. His Majesty assists them with a portion of their maintenance; the rest is provided by their own industry and property.
They have their own steward and their priest, who administers the sacraments to them.<a id="d0e2753src" href="#d0e2753" class="noteref">179</a>

</p>
<p>In another part is the royal hospital for Spaniards, with its physician, apothecary, surgeons, managers, and servants. It
and its church are built of stone; and it has its sick rooms and the bed service. In it all the Spaniards are treated. It
is usually quite full; it is under the royal patronage. His Majesty provides the most necessary things for it. Three discalced
religious of St. Francis act there as superintendents, and they prove very advantageous for the corporal and spiritual relief
of the sick. It was burned in the conflagration of the former year six hundred and three, and is now being rebuilt.

</p>
<p>There is another charitable hospital in charge of the Confraternity of that name. It was founded in the city of Manila by
the Confraternity of La Misericordia of Lisboa, and by the other confraternities of India.<a id="d0e2763src" href="#d0e2763" class="noteref">180</a> It has apostolic bulls for works of charity, such as burying the dead, supporting the modest poor, marrying orphans, and
relieving many necessities. There the slaves of the city are treated, and <a id="d0e2772"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2772">143</a>]</span>lodgings are likewise provided for poor women.

</p>
<p>Next to the monastery of St. Francis is located the hospital for natives,<a id="d0e2776src" href="#d0e2776" class="noteref">181</a> which is under royal patronage. It was founded with alms, by a holy lay-brother of St. Francis, one Fray Joan Clemente. A
great many natives, suffering from all diseases, are treated there with great care and attention. It has a good edifice and
workrooms built of stone. The discalced religious of St. Francis manage it; and three priests and four lay-brothers, of exemplary
life, live there. These are the physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries of the hospital, and are so skilful and useful, that
they cause many marvelous cures, both in medicine and in surgery.

</p>
<p>The streets of the city are compactly built up with houses, mostly of stone, although some are of wood. Many are roofed with
clay tiling, and others with nipa. They are excellent edifices, lofty and spacious, and have large rooms and many windows,
and balconies, with iron gratings, that embellish them. More are daily being built and finished. There are about six hundred
houses within the walls, and a greater number, built of wood, in the suburbs; and all are the habitations and homes of Spaniards.

</p>
<p>The streets, squares, and churches are generally filled with people of all classes, especially Spaniards&#8212;all, both men and
women, clad and gorgeously adorned in silks. They wear many ornaments and all kinds of fine clothes, because of the ease with
which these are obtained. Consequently this is one of the settlements most highly praised, by the foreigners who resort to
it, of all in the world, both for the above reason, and for the great provision and <a id="d0e2786"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2786">144</a>]</span>abundance of food and other necessaries for human life found there, and sold at moderate prices.

</p>
<p>Manila has two drives for recreation. One is by land, along the point called Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia. It extends for about
a legua along the shore, and is very clean and level. Thence it passes through a native street and settlement, called Bagunbayan,
to a chapel, much frequented by the devout, called Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia, and continues for a goodly distance further to
a monastery and mission-house of the Augustinians, called Mahalat.<a id="d0e2790src" href="#d0e2790" class="noteref">182</a>

</p>
<p>The other drive extends through one of the city gates to a native settlement, called Laguio, by which one may go to a chapel
of San Anton, and to a monastery and mission-house of discalced Franciscans, a place of great devotion, near the city, called
La Candelaria.<a id="d0e2798src" href="#d0e2798" class="noteref">183</a>

</p>
<p>This city is the capital of the kingdom and the head of the government of all the islands. It is the metropolis of the other
cities and settlements of the islands. In it reside the Audiencia and Chanciller&iacute;a of his Majesty, and the governor and captain-general
of the islands.<a id="d0e2806src" href="#d0e2806" class="noteref">184</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e2819"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2819">145</a>]</span>Manila has a city cabildo with two alcaldes-in-ordinary, twelve perpetual regidors, an algua&ccedil;il-mayor [<i>i.e.</i>, chief constable], a royal standard-bearer, the scrivener of the cabildo, and other officials.

</p>
<p>The archbishop of the Filipinas Islands resides in this city. He has his metropolitan church, and all the cathedral dignitaries&#8212;canons,
racioneros, medias racioneros,<a id="d0e2826src" href="#d0e2826" class="noteref">185</a> chaplains, and sacristans&#8212;and a music-choir, who chant to the accompaniment of the organ and of flutes [<i>ministriles</i>]. The cathedral is quite ornate and well decorated, and the Divine offices are celebrated there with the utmost gravity and
ceremony. As suffragans the cathedral has three <a id="d0e2835"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2835">146</a>]</span>bishops&#8212;namely, in the island of Sebu, and in Cagayan and Camarines.<a id="d0e2837src" href="#d0e2837" class="noteref">186</a>

</p>
<p>There is a royal treasury with three royal officials&#8212;factor, accountant, and treasurer&#8212;by whom the royal revenue of all the
islands is managed.<a id="d0e2842src" href="#d0e2842" class="noteref">187</a>

</p>
<p>The vessels sailing annually to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a with the merchandise and investments of all the islands are despatched from the
city of Manila; and they return thither from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a with the proceeds of this merchandise, and the usual re&euml;nforcements.

</p>
<p>In the city is established the camp of the regular soldiers whom his Majesty has had stationed in the islands.

</p>
<p>Several galleys are also stationed at Manila with their general and captains, as well as other war-vessels, of deep draft,
and smaller ones built like those used by the natives, to attend to the needs of all the islands.

</p>
<p>The majority of the vessels from China, Japon, Maluco, Borney, Sian, Malaca, and India, that come to the Filipinas with their
merchandise and articles of trade, gather in the bay and river of Manila. In that city they sell and trade for all the islands
and their settlements.

</p>
<p>In the province [of Cagay&aacute;n] of this same island of Luzon was founded the city of Segovia,<a id="d0e2858src" href="#d0e2858" class="noteref">188</a> during <a id="d0e2864"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2864">147</a>]</span>the term of Don Gon&ccedil;alo Ronquillo, the third governor. It has two hundred Spanish inhabitants who live in wooden houses on
the shore of the Tajo River, two leguas from the sea and port of Camalayuga. There is a stone fort near the city for the defense
of it and of the river. This fort mounts some artillery, and has its own commandant. Besides the inhabitants, there are generally
one hundred regular soldiers, arquebusiers, and their officers. They are all in charge and under command of the alcalde-mayor
of the province, who is its military commander.

</p>
<p>In that city is established a bishop and his church, although at present the latter has no dignitaries or prebendaries.<a id="d0e2868src" href="#d0e2868" class="noteref">189</a> There is a city cabildo consisting of two alcaldes, six regidors, and an alguacil-mayor. The city abounds in all kinds of
food and refreshment at very cheap prices.

</p>
<p>The city of Ca&ccedil;eres was founded in the province of Camarines of the same island of Luzon, during the term of Doctor Sande,
governor of the Filipinas. It has about one hundred Spanish inhabitants; and <a id="d0e2876"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2876">148</a>]</span>has its cabildo, consisting of alcaldes, regidors, and officials. A bishop of that province is established there and has his
church, although without dignitaries or prebendaries. A monastery of discalced Franciscans is located there. The government
and military affairs of that province are under one alcalde-mayor and war-captain, who resides in Ca&ccedil;eres. The latter is a
place abounding in and furnished with all kinds of provisions, at very low rates. It is founded on the bank of a river, four
leguas inland from the sea, and its houses are of wood.

</p>
<p>The fourth city is that called Santisimo Nombre de Jesus; it is located in the island of Sebu, in the province of Bicayas
or Pintados. It was the first Spanish settlement and was founded by the adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, the first governor.
It is a fine seaport, whose water is very clear and deep, and capable of holding many vessels. The city has an excellent stone
fort, which mounts a considerable quantity of artillery, and which has its commandant and officers for the guard and defense
of the port and of the city. It is sufficiently garrisoned with regulars, and is under command of the alcalde-mayor, the military
commander of the province, who lives in the city. The settlement contains about two hundred Spanish inhabitants who live in
houses of wood. It has a cabildo, consisting of two alcaldes-in-ordinary, eight regidors, and an alguacil-mayor and his officers.
It has a bishop and his church, like those of other cities of these islands, without prebendaries.<a id="d0e2880src" href="#d0e2880" class="noteref">190</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e2889"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2889">149</a>]</span>The city is provided with food by, and is a station for, the ships going from Maluco to Manila. Through his Majesty&#8217;s concession
they keep there a deep-draft merchant vessel, which generally leaves its port for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, laden with the merchandise
of the products gathered in those provinces. It has a monastery of Augustinian religious and a seminary of the Society of
Jesus.

</p>
<p>The town of Arevalo was founded on the island of Oton [Panay], during the term of Don Gon&ccedil;alo Ronquillo.<a id="d0e2893src" href="#d0e2893" class="noteref">191</a> It contains about eighty Spanish inhabitants, and is located close to the sea. It has a wooden fort, which mounts some artillery,
and a monastery of the Order of St. Augustine; also a parish church, with its own vicar and secular priest. This church belongs
to the diocese of the Sebu bishopric.

</p>
<p>It has a cabildo, consisting of alcaldes, regidors, and other officials. There is one alcalde-mayor and military leader in
those provinces. The town is well supplied with all kinds of provisions, sold at very low rates.

</p>
<p>The settlement of Villa Fernandina,<a id="d0e2903src" href="#d0e2903" class="noteref">192</a> which was founded in the province of the Ilocos on the island of Luzon, is settled by Spaniards, but very few of them remain
there. It has a church, with its own vicar and secular priest. Now no mention will be made of it, on account of what has been
said. The <a id="d0e2909"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2909">150</a>]</span>alcalde-mayor of the province resides there, and the town is situated in the diocese of the Cagayan bishopric.

</p>
<p>From the earliest beginning of the conquest and pacification of the Filipinas Islands, the preaching of the holy gospel therein
and the conversion of the natives to our holy Catholic faith were undertaken. The first to set hand to this task were the
religious of the Order of St. Augustine, who went there with the adelantado Legazpi in the fleet of discovery, and those of
the same order who went afterward to labor in this work, and toiled therein with great fervor and zeal. Thus, finding the
harvest in good season, they gathered the first fruits of it, and converted and baptized many infidels throughout the said
islands.<a id="d0e2913src" href="#d0e2913" class="noteref">193</a>

</p>
<p>Next to them in the fame of this conversion, the discalced religious of the Order of St. Francis went to the islands by way
of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a; then those of the Order of St. Dominic, and of the Society of Jesus.<a id="d0e2921src" href="#d0e2921" class="noteref">194</a> Lastly, the discalced Augustinian Recollects went. One and all, after being established in the islands, worked in the conversion
and instruction of the natives. Consequently they have made&#8212;and there are now in all the islands&#8212;a great number of baptized
natives, besides many others in many parts, who, for want of laborers, have been put off, and are awaiting this blessing and
priests to minister to them. Hitherto there have been but few missions in charge of secular priests, as not many of these
have <a id="d0e2927"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2927">151</a>]</span>gone to the islands; and as very few have been ordained there, for lack of students.

</p>
<p>The Order of St. Augustine has many missions in the islands of Pintados and has established and occupied monasteries and various
visitas.<a id="d0e2931src" href="#d0e2931" class="noteref">195</a> In the island of Luzon, they have those of the province of Ylocos, some in Pangasinan, and all those of La Pampanga&#8212;a large
number of monasteries; while in the province of Manila and its vicinity they have others, which are flourishing.

</p>
<p>The Order of St. Dominic has the missions of the province of Cagayan, and others in the province of Pangasinan, where are
many monasteries and visitas. They also administer others about the city.

</p>
<p>The Order of St. Francis has some missions and monasteries about Manila, all the province of Camarines and the coast opposite,
and La Laguna de Bay. These include many missions.

</p>
<p>The Society of Jesus has three large missions in the neighborhood of Manila, which have many visitas. In the Pintados it has
many others on the islands of Sebu, Leite, Ybabao, Camar [Samar], Bohol, and others near by. They have good men, who are solicitous
for the conversion of the natives.

</p>
<p>These four orders have produced many good results in the conversion of these islands, as above stated; and in good sooth the
people have taken firm hold of the faith, as they are a people of so good understanding. They have recognized the errors of
their paganism and the truths of the Christian religion; and they possess good and well-built churches and monasteries of
wood with their reredoses and <a id="d0e2944"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2944">152</a>]</span>beautiful ornaments, and all the utensils, crosses, candlesticks, and chalices of silver and gold. Many devotions are offered,
and there are many confraternities. There is assiduity in taking the sacraments and in attendance on the Divine services;
and the people are careful to entertain and support their religious (to whom they show great obedience and respect) by the
many alms that they give them, as well as by those that they give for the suffrages and the burial of their dead, which they
provide with all punctuality and liberality.

</p>
<p>At the same time that the religious undertook to teach the natives the precepts of religion, they labored to instruct them
in matters of their own improvement, and established schools for the reading and writing of Spanish among the boys. They taught
them to serve in the church, to sing the plain-song, and to the accompaniment of the organ; to play the flute, to dance, and
to sing; and to play the harp, guitar, and other instruments. In this they show very great adaptability, especially about
Manila; where there are many fine choirs of chanters and musicians composed of natives, who are skilful and have good voices.
There are many dancers, and musicians on the other instruments which solemnize and adorn the feasts of the most holy sacrament,
and many other feasts during the year. The native boys present dramas and comedies, both in Spanish and in their own language,
very charmingly. This is due to the care and interest of the religious, who work tirelessly for the natives&#8217; advancement.<a id="d0e2948src" href="#d0e2948" class="noteref">196</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e2955"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2955">153</a>]</span>In these islands there is no native province or settlement which resists conversion or does not desire it. But, as above stated,
baptism has been postponed in some districts, for lack of workers to remain with the people, in order that they may not retrograde
and return to their idolatries. In this work, the best that is possible is done, for the mission-fields are very large and
extensive. In many districts the religious make use, in their visitas, of certain of the natives who are clever and well instructed,
so that these may teach the others to pray daily, instruct them in other matters touching religion, and see that they come
to mass at the central missions; and in this way they succeed in preserving and maintaining their converts.

</p>
<p>Hitherto, the orders who control these missions in virtue of the <i>omnimodo</i> and other apostolic concessions<a id="d0e2962src" href="#d0e2962" class="noteref">197</a> have attended to the conversion of the natives, administered the sacraments, looked after the spiritual and temporal and
ecclesiastical affairs of the natives, and absolved them in cases of difficulty. But now that there are an archbishop and
bishops, this is being curtailed, and the management of these affairs is being given to the bishops, as the archbishop&#8217;s vicars&#8212;although
not to such an extent, nor has the administration of these natives been placed in their charge, in matters of justice, and
under the <a id="d0e2968"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2968">154</a>]</span>inspection and superintendence of the bishops, as they have endeavored to obtain.<a id="d0e2970src" href="#d0e2970" class="noteref">198</a>

</p>
<p>The governor and royal Audiencia of Manila attend to what it is advisable to provide and direct for the greatest accomplishment
and advancement of this conversion, and the administration of the natives and their missions&#8212;both by causing the encomenderos
to assist the religious and churches, in the encomiendas that they enjoy, with the stipends and necessary expenses of the
missions; and by furnishing from the royal revenues what pertains to it, which is no less a sum.<a id="d0e2978src" href="#d0e2978" class="noteref">199</a> They also ordain whatever else is required to be provided and remedied for the said missions and for the advancement of the
natives. This also is attended to by the archbishop and the bishops in what pertains to them in their duty and charge as pastors.

</p>
<p>The Holy Office of the Inquisition, residing in Mexico of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, has its commissaries, servants, and helpers in Manila
and in the bishoprics of the islands, who attend to matters touching the <a id="d0e2989"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2989">155</a>]</span>Holy Office. They never fail to have plenty to do there because of the entrance of so many strangers into those districts.
However, this holy tribunal does not have jurisdiction of the causes pertaining to the natives, as the latter are so recently
converted.

</p>
<p>All these islands are subdued, and are governed from Manila by means of alcaldes-mayor, corregidors, and lieutenants, each
of whom rules and administers justice in his own district and province. Appeals from their acts and sentences go to the royal
Audiencia. The governor and captain-general provides what pertains to government and war.

</p>
<p>The chiefs, who formerly held the other natives in subjection, now have no power over them in the tyrannical manner of former
days. This was not the least benefit received by these natives in having been freed from such servitude. However, it is true
that matters touching the slavery of former days have remained on the same footing as before. The king our sovereign has ordered
by his decrees that the honors of the chiefs be preserved to them as such; and that the other natives recognize them and assist
them with certain of the labors that they used to give when pagans. This is done with the lords and possessors of barangays,
and those belonging to such and such a barangay are under that chief&#8217;s control. When he harvests his rice, they go one day
to help him; and the same if he builds a house, or rebuilds one. This chief lord of a barangay collects tribute from his adherents,
and takes charge of these collections, to pay them to the encomendero.<a id="d0e2995src" href="#d0e2995" class="noteref">200</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e3003"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3003">156</a>]</span>Besides the above, each village has a governor<a id="d0e3005src" href="#d0e3005" class="noteref">201</a> who is elected. He and his constables who are called <i>vilangos</i><a id="d0e3013src" href="#d0e3013" class="noteref">202</a> comprise the usual magistracy among the natives. The governor hears civil suits where a moderate sum is involved; in appeal,
the case goes to the corregidor or alcalde-mayor of the province. These governors are elected annually by the votes of all
the married natives of such and such a village. The governor of Manila confirms the election, and gives the title of governor
to the one elected, and orders him to take the residencia of the outgoing governor.<a id="d0e3024src" href="#d0e3024" class="noteref">203</a> This governor, in addition to the vilangos and scrivener (before whom he makes his acts in writing, in the language of the
natives of that province),<a id="d0e3033src" href="#d0e3033" class="noteref">204</a> holds also the chiefs&#8212;lords of barangays, and those who are not so&#8212;under his rule and government, and, for any special service,
such as collections of tributes, and assignments of personal services, <a id="d0e3039"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3039">157</a>]</span>as his <i>datos</i> and <i>mandones</i>.<a id="d0e3047src" href="#d0e3047" class="noteref">205</a> They do not allow the chiefs to oppress the timaguas or slaves under their control.

</p>
<p>The same customs observed by these natives in their paganism, are observed by them since they have become Christians, in so
far as they are not contrary to natural law, especially as to their slavery, successions, inheritances, adoptions, wills,
and lawful trading. In their suits, they always allege and prove the custom, and are judged by it, according to royal decrees
to that effect. In other causes which do not involve their customs, and in criminal cases, the matter is determined by law
as among Spaniards.

</p>
<p>All of these islands and their natives, so far as they were pacified, were apportioned into encomiendas from the beginning.
To the royal crown were allotted those which were chief towns and ports, and the dwellers of the cities and towns; and also
other special encomiendas and villages in all the provinces, for the necessities and expenses of the royal estate. All the
rest was assigned to the conquerors and settlers who have served and labored for the conquest and pacification, and in the
war. This matter is in charge of the governor, who takes into consideration the merits and services of the claimants.<a id="d0e3063src" href="#d0e3063" class="noteref">206</a> In like <a id="d0e3071"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3071">158</a>]</span>manner the villages that become vacant are assigned. There are many very excellent encomiendas throughout the islands, and
they offer many profits, both by the amount of their tributes and by the nature and value of what is paid as tribute.<a id="d0e3073src" href="#d0e3073" class="noteref">207</a> The encomienda lasts, according to the royal laws and decrees, and by the regular order and manner of succession to them,
for two lives; but it may be extended to a third life, by permission. After it becomes vacant, it is again assigned and granted
anew.

</p>
<p>The tributes paid to their encomenderos by the natives were assigned by the first governor, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, in the
provinces of Vicayas and Pintados, and in the islands of Luzon and its vicinity; they were equal to the sum of eight reals
annually for an entire tribute from each tributario. The natives were to pay it in their products&#8212;in gold, cloth, cotton,
rice, bells, fowls, and whatever else they possessed or harvested. The fixed price and value of <a id="d0e3081"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3081">159</a>]</span>each article was assigned so that, when the tribute was paid in any one of them, or in all of them, it should not exceed the
value of the eight reals. So it has continued until now, and the governors have increased the appraisements and values of
the products at different times, as they have deemed advisable.

</p>
<p>The encomenderos have made great profits in collecting in kind, for, after they acquired possession of the products, they
sold them at higher prices. By this they increased their incomes and the proceeds of their encomiendas considerably; until
a few years ago his Majesty, by petition of the religious and the pressure that they brought to bear on him in this matter,
ordered for this region that the natives should pay their tribute in whatever they wished&#8212;in kind or in money&#8212;without being
compelled to do otherwise. Consequently, when they should have paid their eight reals, they would have fulfilled their obligation.
Accordingly this rule was initiated; but experience demonstrates that, although it seemed a merciful measure, and one favorable
to the natives, it is doing them great injury. For, since they naturally dislike to work, they do not sow, spin, dig gold,
rear fowls, or raise other food supplies, as they did before, when they had to pay the tribute in those articles. They easily
obtain, without so much work, the peso of money which is the amount of their tribute. Consequently it follows that the natives
have less capital and wealth, because they do not work; and the country, which was formerly very well provided and well-supplied
with all products, is now suffering want and deprivation of them. The owners of the encomiendas, both those of his Majesty
and those of private persons who possess them, have sustained <a id="d0e3085"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3085">160</a>]</span>considerable loss and reduction in the value of the encomiendas.

</p>
<p>When Gomez Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as was appointed governor of the Filipinas, he brought royal decrees ordering the formation of the
camp in Manila, with an enrollment of four hundred paid soldiers, with their officers, galleys, and other military supplies,
for the defense and security of the country. Before that time all the Spanish inhabitants had attended to that without any
pay. Then an increase of two reals to each tributario over the eight reals was ordered. This was to be collected by the encomenderos
at the same time when they collected the eight reals of the tribute, and was to be delivered and placed in the royal treasury.
There this amount was to be entered on an account separate from that of the other revenue of his Majesty, and was to be applied
in the following manner: one and one-half reals for the expenses of the said camp and war stores; and the remaining half real
for the pay of the prebendaries of the Manila church, which his Majesty pays from his treasury, until such time as their tithes
and incomes suffice for their sustenance.<a id="d0e3089src" href="#d0e3089" class="noteref">208</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e3098"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3098">161</a>]</span>These tributes are collected from all the natives, Christians and infidels, in their entirety&#8212;except that in those encomiendas
without instruction the encomendero does not take the fourth part of the eight reals (which equals two reals) for himself,
since that encomienda has no instruction or expenses for it; but he takes them and deposits them in Manila, in a fund called
&#8220;the fourths.&#8221;<a id="d0e3100src" href="#d0e3100" class="noteref">209</a> The money obtained from this source is applied to and spent in hospitals for the natives, and in other works beneficial to
them, at the option of the governor. As fast as the encomiendas are supplied with instruction and religious, the collection
of these fourths and their expenditure in these special works cease.

</p>
<p>Some provinces have taken the census of their natives; and according to these the tributes and the assignment of the two reals
are collected.

</p>
<p>In most of the provinces no census has been taken, and the tributes are collected when due by the encomenderos <a id="d0e3112"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3112">162</a>]</span>and their collectors, through the chiefs of their encomiendas, by means of the lists and memoranda of former years. From them
the names of the deceased and of those who have changed their residence are erased, and the names of those who have grown
up, and of those who have recently moved into the encomienda, are added. When any shortage is perceived in the accounts, a
new count is requested and made.

</p>
<p>The natives are free to move from one island to another, and from one province to another, and pay their tribute for that
year in which they move and change their residence in the place to which they move; and to move from a Christian village that
has instruction to another village possessing it. But, on the other hand, they may not move from a place having instruction
to one without it, nor in the same village from one barangay to another, nor from one faction to another. In this respect,
the necessary precautions are made by the government, and the necessary provisions by the Audiencia, so that this system may
be kept, and so that all annoyances resulting from the moving of the settled natives of one place to another place may be
avoided.

</p>
<p>Neither are the natives allowed to go out of their villages for trade, except by permission of the governor, or of his alcaldes-mayor
and justices, or even of the religious, who most often have been embarrassed by this, because of the instruction. This is
<a id="d0e3118"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3118">163</a>]</span>done so that the natives may not wander about aimlessly when there is no need of it, away from their homes and settlements.

</p>
<p>Those natives who possess slaves pay their tributes for them if the slaves are <i>saguiguilirs</i>. If the slaves are <i>namamahays</i> living outside their owners&#8217; houses, they pay their own tributes, inasmuch as they possess their own houses and means of
gain.

</p>
<p>The Spaniards used to have slaves from these natives, whom they had bought from them, and others whom they obtained in certain
expeditions during the conquest and pacification of the islands. This was stopped by a brief of his Holiness<a id="d0e3130src" href="#d0e3130" class="noteref">210</a> and by royal decrees. Consequently, all of these slaves who were then in the possession of the Spanish, and who were natives
of these islands, in whatever manner they had been acquired, were freed; and the Spaniards were forever prohibited from holding
them as slaves, or <a id="d0e3136"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3136">164</a>]</span>from capturing them for any reason, or under pretext of war, or in any other manner. The service rendered by these natives
is in return for pay and daily wages. The other slaves and captives that the Spaniards possess are Cafres and blacks brought
by the Portuguese by way of India, and are held in slavery justifiably, in accordance with the provincial councils and the
permissions of the prelates and justices of those districts.

</p>
<p>The natives of these islands have also their personal services, which they are obliged to render&#8212;in some parts more than in
others&#8212;to the Spaniards. These are done in different ways, and are commonly called the <i>polo</i>.<a id="d0e3143src" href="#d0e3143" class="noteref">211</a> For, where there are alcaldes-mayor and justices, they assign and distribute certain natives by the week for the service
of their houses. They pay these servants a moderate wage, which generally amounts to one-fourth real per day, and rice for
their food. The same is done by the religious for the mission, and for their monasteries and churches, and for their works,
and for public works.<a id="d0e3149src" href="#d0e3149" class="noteref">212</a>

</p>
<p>The Indians also furnish rice, and food of all <a id="d0e3159"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3159">165</a>]</span>kinds, at the prices at which they are valued and sold among the natives. These prices are always very moderate. The datos,
vilangos, and fiscals make the division, collect, and take these supplies from the natives; and in the same manner they supply
their encomenderos when these go to make the collections.

</p>
<p>The greatest service rendered by these natives is on occasions of war, when they act as rowers and crews for the vireys and
vessels that go on the expeditions, and as pioneers for any service that arises in the course of the war, although their pay
and wages are given them.

</p>
<p>In the same way natives are assigned and apportioned for the king&#8217;s works, such as the building of ships, the cutting of wood,
the trade of making the rigging,<a id="d0e3165src" href="#d0e3165" class="noteref">213</a> the work in the artillery foundry, and the service in the royal<a id="d0e3171src" href="#d0e3171" class="noteref">214</a> magazines; and they are paid their stipend and daily wage.

</p>
<p>In other things pertaining to the service of the Spaniards and their expeditions, works, and any other service, performed
by the natives, the service is voluntary, and paid by mutual agreement;<a id="d0e3179src" href="#d0e3179" class="noteref">215</a> for, as hitherto, the Spaniards have worked no mines, nor have they given themselves to the gains to be derived from field
labors, there is no occasion for employing the natives in anything of that sort.

</p>
<p>Most of the Spaniards of the Filipinas Islands reside in the city of Manila, the capital of the kingdom, <a id="d0e3189"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3189">166</a>]</span>and where the chief trade and commerce is carried on. Some encomenderos live in provinces or districts adjacent to Manila,
while other Spaniards live in the cities of Segovia, Ca&ccedil;eres, Santisimo Nombre de Jesus (in Sebu), and in the town of Arevalo,
where they are settled, and where most of them have their encomiendas.

</p>
<p>Spaniards may not go to the Indian villages,<a id="d0e3193src" href="#d0e3193" class="noteref">216</a> except for the collection of the tributes when they are due; and then only the alcaldes-mayor, corregidors, and justices.
It is not permitted these to remain continually in one settlement of their district, but they must visit as much of it as
possible. They must change their residence and place of abode every four months to another chief village and settlement, where
all the natives may obtain the benefit of their presence; and so that the natives may receive as slight annoyance as possible
in supporting them and in the ordinary service that they render them.<a id="d0e3199src" href="#d0e3199" class="noteref">217</a>

</p>
<p>The governor makes appointments to all offices. When the term of office expires, the royal Aurdiencia orders the residencia
of each official to be taken, and his case is decided in accordance therewith; and until the residencia is completed, the
incumbent cannot be appointed to any other duty or office. The governor also appoints commandants of forts, companies, <a id="d0e3204"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3204">167</a>]</span>and other military officials, in all the cities, towns, and hamlets of the islands.<a id="d0e3206src" href="#d0e3206" class="noteref">218</a>

</p>
<p>Certain offices of regidors and notaries have been sold by royal decree for one life. But the sale of these offices has been
superseded, as it is now considered that the price paid for them is of little consideration, while the disadvantage of perpetuating
the purchasers in office by this method is greater.

</p>
<p>Elections of alcaldes-in-ordinary for all the Spanish towns are held on New Year&#8217;s day by the cabildo and magistracy. The
residencias of these alcaldes-in-ordinary and their cabildos are ordered by his Majesty to be taken at the same time as that
of the governor and captain-general of the islands is taken; and they give account of the administration of the revenues and
the estates under their care. However, the governor may take it before this, every year, or whenever he thinks it expedient
and cause the balances of their accounts to be collected. With the governor&#8217;s advice and permission the expenses desired by
the towns are made.

</p>
<p>The city of Manila has sufficient public funds for certain years, through the fines imposed by its judges; in its own particular
possessions, inside and outside the city; in the reweighing of the merchandise and the rents of all the shops and sites of
the Sangleys in the pari&aacute;n; and in the monopoly on playing cards. All this was conceded to the city by his <a id="d0e3220"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3220">168</a>]</span>Majesty, especially for the expenses of its fortification.<a id="d0e3222src" href="#d0e3222" class="noteref">219</a> These revenues are spent for that purpose; for the salaries of its officials, and those of the agents sent to Espa&ntilde;a; and
for the feasts of the city, chief of which are St. Potenciana&#8217;s day, May nineteen, when the Spaniards entered and seized the
city, and the day of St. Andrew, November 30, the date on which the pirate Limahon was conquered and driven from the city.
On that day the city officials take out the municipal standard, and to the sound of music go to vespers and mass at the church
of San Andres, where the entire city, with the magistracy and cabildo and the royal Audiencia, assemble with all solemnity.
The above revenues are also used in receiving the governors at their first arrival in the country, in the kings&#8217; marriage
feasts, and the births of princes, and in the honors and funeral celebrations for the kings and princes who die. In all the
above the greatest possible display is made.

</p>
<p>The other cities and settlements do not possess as yet so many sources of wealth or revenue, or the occasions on which to
spend them&#8212;although, as far as possible, they take part in them, in all celebrations of the same kind.

</p>
<p>The Spaniards living in the islands are divided into five classes of people: namely, prelates, religious, and ecclesiastical
ministers, both secular and regular; encomenderos, settlers, and conquerors; soldiers, officers, and officials of war (both
on land and sea), and those for navigation; merchants, business men, and traders; and his Majesty&#8217;s agents for government,
<a id="d0e3232"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3232">169</a>]</span>justice, and administration of his royal revenue.

</p>
<p>The ecclesiastical prelates have already been stated, and are as follows: The archbishop of Manila, who resides in the city,
as metropolitan, in charge of his cathedral church; he has a salary of four thousand pesos,<a id="d0e3236src" href="#d0e3236" class="noteref">220</a> which is paid from the royal treasury annually. Likewise the salaries paid to the holders of the dignidades,<a id="d0e3242src" href="#d0e3242" class="noteref">221</a> canonries, and other prebends, and those performing other services, are paid in the same manner. They are all under royal
patronage, and are provided in accordance with the king&#8217;s orders. The archbishop&#8217;s office and jurisdiction consists of and
extends to all, both the spiritual and temporal, that is ecclesiastic, and to its management.<a id="d0e3255src" href="#d0e3255" class="noteref">222</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e3264"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3264">170</a>]</span>The bishop of the city of Santisimo Nombre de Jesus in Sibu, that of Segovia in Cagayan, and that of Caceres in Camarines,
have the same rights of jurisdiction and enjoy the same privileges in their dioceses, since they are suffragans of the archbishop
of Manila; appeal from their judgments is made to the latter, and he summons and convokes them to his provincial councils
whenever necessary. They receive each an annual salary of five hundred thousand maravedis for their support, which is paid
from the royal treasury of Manila, besides their offerings and pontifical dues. All together it is quite sufficient for their
support, according to the convenience of things and the cheapness of the country. At present the bishops do not possess churches
with prebendaries nor is any money set aside for that.<a id="d0e3266src" href="#d0e3266" class="noteref">223</a>

</p>
<p>The regular prelates are the provincials of the four mendicant orders, namely, St. Dominic, St. Augustine, St. Francis, the
Society of Jesus, and the discalced Augustinians.<a id="d0e3274src" href="#d0e3274" class="noteref">224</a> Each prelate governs his own order and visits the houses. The orders have nearly all the missions to the natives under their
charge, in whatever pertains to the administration of the sacraments and conversion&#8212;by favor of, and in accordance with, their
privileges and the apostolic bulls, in which until now they have maintained themselves&#8212;and in what pertains to judicial matters,
as <a id="d0e3277"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3277">171</a>]</span>vicars of the bishops, and through appointment and authorization of the latter. The discalced Augustinians as yet have no
missions, as they have but recently entered the islands.

</p>
<p>The monasteries are supported by certain special incomes that they possess and have acquired&#8212;especially those of the Augustinians
and those of the Society&#8212;and by help and concessions granted by his Majesty. The Dominicans and Franciscans do not possess
or allow incomes or properties;<a id="d0e3281src" href="#d0e3281" class="noteref">225</a> and for them, as for the other orders, the principal source of revenue is in the alms, offerings, and aid given by the districts
where they are established and where they have charge. This help is given by both Spaniards and natives, very piously and
generously. They are aided also by the stipend given them from the encomiendas for the instruction that they give there. Consequently
the religious of the orders live well and with the comfort necessary.

</p>
<p>The first encomenderos, conquerors, and settlers of the islands, and their issue, are honorably supported by the products
of their encomiendas, and by certain means of gain and trading interests that they possess, as do the rest of the people.
There are a great number of them, each one of whom lives and possesses his house in the city and settlement of Spaniards in
whose province he has his encomienda. This they do in order not to abandon their encomiendas, and thus they are nearer the
latter for their needs and for collections.

</p>
<p>Now but few of the first conquerors who gained the country and went there for its conquest with the <a id="d0e3291"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3291">172</a>]</span>adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legaspi remain alive.

</p>
<p>The soldiers and officers of war and of naval expeditions formerly consisted of all the dwellers and inhabitants of the islands,
who rendered military service without any pay or salary. They went on all the expeditions and pacifications that arose, and
guarded the forts and presidios, and cities and settlements. This was their principal exercise and occupation. They were rewarded
by the governor, who provided them with encomiendas, offices, and profits of the country according to their merits and services.<a id="d0e3295src" href="#d0e3295" class="noteref">226</a>

</p>
<p>At that time the soldiers of the islands were the best in the Indias. They were very skilful and well-disciplined by both
land and sea, and were esteemed and respected by all those nations. They gloried in their arms, and in acquitting themselves
valiantly.

</p>
<p>Afterward, when Gomez Perez Das Mari&ntilde;as entered upon the government of the Filipinas, he founded the regular camp of four
hundred soldiers: the arquebusiers, with pay of six pesos per month; the musketeers, with eight pesos; six captains, with
annual pay of four hundred and twenty pesos apiece; their alf&eacute;reces, sergeants, corporals, standard-bearers, and drummers,
with pay in proportion to their duties; one master-of-camp, with annual pay of one thousand four hundred pesos; one sargento-mayor
with captain&#8217;s pay; one adjutant of the sargento-mayor <a id="d0e3305"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3305">173</a>]</span>and field-captain, with monthly pay of ten pesos; two castellans; commandants of the two fortresses of Manila, with four hundred
pesos apiece annually; their lieutenants; squads of soldiers and artillerymen; one general of galleys, with annual pay of
eight hundred pesos; each galley one captain, with annual pay of three hundred pesos; their boatswains, boatswains&#8217; mates,
coxswains, alguacils of the galleys, soldiers, artillerymen, master-carpenters, riggers, sailors, conscripts,<a id="d0e3307src" href="#d0e3307" class="noteref">227</a> galley-crews of Spanish, Sangley, and native convicts, condemned for crimes; and, when there is lack of convicts, good rowers
are obtained from the natives for pay, for the period of the expedition and the occasion of the voyage.<a id="d0e3312src" href="#d0e3312" class="noteref">228</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e3338"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3338">174</a>]</span>In the vessels and fleets of large vessels for the Nueva Espa&ntilde;a line, the ships that are sent carry a general, admiral, masters,
boatswains, commissaries, stewards, alguacils, sergeants of marine artillery [<i>condestables</i>], artillerymen, sailors, pilots and their assistants, common seamen, carpenters, calkers, and coopers, all in his Majesty&#8217;s
pay, on the account of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, from whose royal treasury they are paid. All that is necessary for this navigation is
supplied there. Their provisions and appointments are made by the viceroy; and this has hitherto pertained to him, even though
the ships may have been constructed in the Filipinas. They sail thence with their cargo of merchandise for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and
return thence to the Filipinas with the re&euml;nforcements of soldiers and supplies, and whatever else is necessary for the camp,
besides passengers and religious, <a id="d0e3343"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3343">175</a>]</span>and the money proceeding from the investments and merchandise.<a id="d0e3345src" href="#d0e3345" class="noteref">229</a>

</p>
<p>After the establishment of a regular camp for guard and expeditions, the other inhabitants, dwellers, and residents were enrolled
without pay under the banners of six captains of the Filipinas, for special occasions requiring the defense of the city. But
they were relieved of all other duties pertaining to the troops, unless they should offer of their own accord to go upon any
expedition, or volunteer for any special occasion, in order to acquire merits and benefits, so that they may be given encomiendas
that become vacant, and offices, and the means of profit of the country. They are not compelled or obliged to do this, unless
they are encomenderos. Consequently all have given themselves to trading, as there is no <a id="d0e3366"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3366">176</a>]</span>other occupation, but they are not unmindful of military service.

</p>
<p>His Majesty prohibits all who are in his pay in the military forces of the islands from engaging in commerce; and orders the
governor not to allow this, or permit them to export goods to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. If the governors would observe that order, it
would not be amiss.<a id="d0e3370src" href="#d0e3370" class="noteref">230</a>

</p>
<p>The merchants and business men form the bulk of the residents of the islands, because of the great amount of merchandise brought
there&#8212;outside of native products&#8212;from China, Japon, Maluco, Malaca, Sian, Camboja, Borneo, and other districts. They invest
in this merchandise and export it annually in the vessels that sail to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and at times to Japon, where great profits
are made from raw silk. Thence on the return to Manila are brought the proceeds, which hitherto have resulted in large and
splendid profits.

</p>
<p>Through the very great increase of this trade&#8212;which was harmful and prejudicial to the Spanish merchants who shipped goods
to Peru and Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and to the royal duties collected on the shipments from Espa&ntilde;a&#8212;and through the business men of Mexico
and Peru having become greedy of trade and commerce with the Filipinas, by means of their agents and factors, so that the
trade with Espa&ntilde;a was ceasing in great measure, and the merchants were sending to the Filipinas for their investments great
consignments of silver, which by that means flowed yearly from his Majesty&#8217;s kingdoms, to fall into the possession of infidels:
all persons of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a <a id="d0e3383"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3383">177</a>]</span>and Peru were prohibited from trading and engaging in commerce in the Filipinas, and from taking the Chinese merchandise to
those regions.<a id="d0e3385src" href="#d0e3385" class="noteref">231</a> Permission was given to the inhabitants and residents of the Filipinas that they alone might trade in the said merchandise,
and export it. They are to take these goods themselves, or send them with persons who belong to the islands, so that they
may sell them. From the proceeds of the said merchandise, they may not carry to the Filipinas more than five hundred thousand
pesos each year.<a id="d0e3400src" href="#d0e3400" class="noteref">232</a>

</p>
<p>A considerable number of <i>somas</i> and junks (which are large vessels) generally come from Great China to Manila, laden with merchandise. Every year thirty
or even forty ships are wont to come, and although they do not come together, in the form of a trading and war fleet, still
they do come in groups with the monsoon and settled weather, which is generally at the new moon in March. They belong to the
provinces of Canton, Chincheo, and Ucheo <a id="d0e3411"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3411">178</a>]</span>[Fo-Kien], and sail from those provinces. They make their voyage to the city of Manila in fifteen or twenty days, sell their
merchandise, and return in good season, before the vendavals set in&#8212;the end of May and a few days of June&#8212;in order not to
endanger their voyage.

</p>
<p>These vessels come laden with merchandise, and bring wealthy merchants who own the ships, and servants and factors of other
merchants who remain in China. They leave China with the permission and license of the Chinese viceroys and mandarins. The
merchandise that they generally bring and sell to the Spaniards consists of raw silk in bundles, of the fineness of two strands
[<i>dos cabe&ccedil;as</i>], and other silk of poorer quality; fine untwisted silk, white and of all colors, wound in small skeins; quantities of velvets,
some plain, and some embroidered in all sorts of figures, colors, and fashions&#8212;others with body of gold, and embroidered with
gold; woven stuffs and brocades, of gold and silver upon silk of various colors and patterns; quantities of gold and silver
thread in skeins over thread and silk&#8212;but the glitter of all the gold and silver is false, and only on paper; damasks, satins,
taffetans, <i>gorvaranes</i>, <i>picotes</i>,<a id="d0e3424src" href="#d0e3424" class="noteref">233</a> and other cloths of all colors, some finer and better than others; a quantity of linen made from grass, called len&ccedil;esuelo
[handkerchief];<a id="d0e3433src" href="#d0e3433" class="noteref">234</a> and white <a id="d0e3444"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3444">179</a>]</span>cotton cloth of different kinds and qualities, for all uses. They also bring musk, benzoin, and ivory; many bed ornaments,
hangings, coverlets, and tapestries of embroidered velvet; damask and gorvaran of different shades; tablecloths, cushions,
and carpets; horse-trappings of the same stuff, and embroidered with glass beads and seed-pearls; also some pearls and rubies,
sapphires and crystal-stones; metal basins, copper kettles, and other copper and cast-iron pots; quantities of all sorts of
nails, sheet-iron, tin and lead; saltpetre and gunpowder. They supply the Spaniards with wheat flour; preserves made of orange,
peach, <i>scorzonera</i>,<a id="d0e3449src" href="#d0e3449" class="noteref">235</a> pear, nutmeg, and ginger, and other fruits of China; salt pork and other salt meats; live fowls of good breed, and very fine
capons; quantities of green fruit, oranges of all kinds; excellent chestnuts, walnuts, <a id="d0e3457"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3457">180</a>]</span>pears, and <i>chicueyes</i><a id="d0e3461src" href="#d0e3461" class="noteref">236</a> (both green and dried, a delicious fruit); quantities of fine thread of all kinds, needles, and knick-knacks; little boxes
and writing-cases; beds, tables, chairs, and gilded benches, painted in many figures and patterns. They bring domestic buffaloes;
geese that resemble swans; horses, some mules and asses; even caged birds, some of which talk, while others sing, and they
make them play innumerable tricks. The Chinese furnish numberless other gewgaws and ornaments of little value and worth, which
are esteemed among the Spaniards; besides a quantity of fine crockery of all kinds; <i>canganes</i>,<a id="d0e3485src" href="#d0e3485" class="noteref">237</a> <i>sines</i>, and black and blue robes; <i>tacley</i>, which are beads of all kinds; strings of cornelians, and other beads and precious stones of all colors; pepper and other
spices; and rarities&#8212;which, did I refer to them all, I would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it.

</p>
<p>As soon as the ship reaches the mouth of the bay of Manila, the watchman stationed at the island of Miraveles goes out to
it in a light vessel. Having examined the ship, he puts a guard of two or three <a id="d0e3499"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3499">181</a>]</span>soldiers on it, so that it may anchor upon the bar, near the city, and to see that no one shall disembark from the vessel,
or anyone enter it from outside, until the vessel has been inspected. By the signal made with fire by the watchman from the
said island, and the advice that he sends in all haste to the city&#8212;of what ship it is, whence it has come, what merchandise
and people it brings&#8212;before the vessel has finished anchoring, the governor and the city generally know all about it.<a id="d0e3501src" href="#d0e3501" class="noteref">238</a>

</p>
<p>When the vessel has arrived and anchored, the royal officials go to inspect it and the register of the merchandise aboard
it. At the same time the valuation of the cargo is made according to law, of what it is worth in Manila; for the vessel immediately
pays three per cent on everything to his Majesty.<a id="d0e3509src" href="#d0e3509" class="noteref">239</a> After the register has been inspected and the valuation made, then the merchandise is immediately unloaded by another official
into champans, and taken <a id="d0e3524"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3524">182</a>]</span>to the Pari&aacute;n, or to other houses and magazines, outside of the city. There the goods are freely sold.

</p>
<p>No Spaniard, Sangley, or other person is allowed to go to the ship to buy or trade merchandise, food, or anything else. Neither
is it allowed, when the merchandise is ashore, to take it from them or buy it with force and violence; but the trade must
be free, and the Sangleys can do what they like with their property.

</p>
<p>The ordinary price of the silks (both raw and woven) and the cloths&#8212;which form the bulk of the cargo&#8212;is settled leisurely,
and by persons who understand it, both on the part of the Spaniards and that of the Sangleys. The purchase price is paid in
silver and reals, for the Sangleys do not want gold, or any other articles, and will not take other things to China. All the
trading must be completed by the end of the month of May, or thereabout, in order that the Sangleys may return and the Spaniards
have the goods ready to lade upon the vessels that go to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a by the end of June. However, the larger dealers and
those who have most money usually do their trading after that time, at lower rates, and keep the merchandise until the following
year. Certain Sangleys remain in Manila with a portion of their merchandise for the same purpose, when they have not had a
good sale for it, in order to go on selling it more leisurely. The Sangleys are very skilful <a id="d0e3530"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3530">183</a>]</span>and intelligent traders, and of great coolness and moderation, in order to carry on their business better. They are ready
to trust and accommodate freely whoever they know treats them fairly, and does not fail in his payments to them when these
are due. On the other hand, as they are a people without religion or conscience, and so greedy, they commit innumerable frauds
and deceits in their merchandise. The purchaser must watch them very closely, and know them, in order not to be cheated by
them. The purchasers, however, acquit themselves by their poor payments and the debts that they incur; and both sides generally
keep the judges and Audiencia quite busy.

</p>
<p>Some Japanese and Portuguese merchantmen also come every year from the port of Nangasaque in Japon, at the end of October
with the north winds, and at the end of March. They enter and anchor at Manila in the same way. The bulk of their cargo is
excellent wheat-flour for the provisioning of Manila, and highly prized salt meats. They also bring some fine woven silk goods
of mixed colors; beautiful and finely-decorated screens done in oil and gilt; all kinds of cutlery; many suits of armor, spears,
catans, and other weapons, all finely wrought; writing-cases, boxes and small cases of wood, japanned and curiously marked;
other pretty gewgaws; excellent fresh pears; barrels and casks of good salt tunny; cages of sweet-voiced larks, called <i>fimbaros</i>; and other trifles. In this trading, some purchases are also made, without royal duties being collected from those vessels.
The bulk of the merchandise is used in the country, but some goods are exported to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. The price is generally paid
in reals, although <a id="d0e3537"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3537">184</a>]</span>they are not so greedy for them as the Chinese, for there is silver in Japon. They generally bring a quantity of it as merchandise
in plates, and it is sold at moderate rates.

</p>
<p>These vessels return to Japon at the season of the vendavals, during the months of June and July. They carry from Manila their
purchases, which are composed of raw Chinese silk, gold, deerskin, and brazil-wood for their dyes. They take honey, manufactured
wax, palm and Castilian wine, civet-cats, large tibors in which to store their tea, glass, cloth, and other curiosities from
Espa&ntilde;a.

</p>
<p>Some Portuguese vessels sail to Manila annually during the monsoon of the vendavals, from Maluco, Malaca, and India. They
take merchandise consisting of spices&#8212;cloves, cinnamon, and pepper; slaves, both blacks and Cafres; cotton cloth of all sorts,
fine muslins [<i>caniquies</i>], linens, gauzes, <i>rambuties</i>, and other delicate and precious cloths; amber, and ivory; cloths edged with <i>pita</i>,<a id="d0e3552src" href="#d0e3552" class="noteref">240</a> for use as bed-covers; hangings, and rich counterpanes from Vengala [Bengal], Cochin, and other countries; many gilt articles
and curiosities; jewels of diamonds, rubies, sapphires, topazes, balas-rubies, and other precious stones, both set and loose;
many trinkets and ornaments from India; wine, raisins, and almonds; delicious preserves, and other fruits brought from Portugal
and prepared in Goa; carpets and tapestries from Persia and Turquia, made <a id="d0e3570"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3570">185</a>]</span>of fine silks and wools; beds, writing-cases, parlor-chairs, and other finely-gilded furniture, made in Macao; needle-work
in colors and in white, of chain-lace and royal point lace, and other fancy-work of great beauty and perfection. Purchases
of all the above are made in Manila, and paid in reals and gold. The vessels return in January with the brisas, which is their
favorable monsoon. They carry to Maluco provisions of rice and wine, crockery-ware, and other wares needed there; while to
Malaca they take only the gold or money, besides a few special trinkets and curiosities from Espa&ntilde;a, and emeralds. The royal
duties are not collected from these vessels.

</p>
<p>A few smaller vessels also sail from Borneo, during the vendavals. They belong to the natives of that island, and return during
the first part of the brisas. They enter the river of Manila and sell their cargoes in their vessels. These consist of fine
and well-made palm-mats, a few slaves for the natives, sago&#8212;a certain food of theirs prepared from the pith of palms&#8212;and tibors;
large and small jars, glazed black and very fine, which are of great service and use; and excellent camphor, which is produced
on that island. Although beautiful diamonds are found on the opposite coast, they are not taken to Manila by those vessels,
for the Portuguese of Malaca trade for them on that coast. These articles from Borneo are bought more largely by the natives
than by the Spaniards. The articles taken back by the Borneans are provisions of wine and rice, cotton cloth, and other wares
of the islands, which are wanting in Borneo.

</p>
<p>Very seldom a few vessels sail to Manila from Sian and Camboja. They carry some benzoin, pepper, <a id="d0e3576"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3576">186</a>]</span>ivory, and cotton cloth; rubies and sapphires, badly cut and set; a few slaves; rhinoceros horns, and the hides, hoofs, and
teeth of this animal; and other goods. In return they take the wares found in Manila. Their coming and return is between the
brisas and the vendavals, during the months of April, May, and June.

</p>
<p>In these classes of merchandise, and in the products of the islands&#8212;namely, gold, cotton cloth, mendri&ntilde;aque, and cakes of
white and yellow wax&#8212;do the Spaniards effect their purchases, investments, and exports for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. They make these as
is most suitable for each person, and lade them on the vessels that are to make the voyage. They value and register these
goods, for they pay into the royal treasury of Manila, before the voyage, the two per cent royal duties on exports, besides
the freight charges of the vessel, which amount to forty Castilian ducados<a id="d0e3580src" href="#d0e3580" class="noteref">241</a> per tonelada. This latter is paid at the port of Acapulco in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, into the royal treasury of the said port, in addition
to the ten per cent duties for entrance and first sale in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. <a id="d0e3586src" href="#d0e3586" class="noteref">242</a>

</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the ships which are despatched with the said merchandise are at his Majesty&#8217;s account, and other ships cannot
be sent, there is generally too small a place in the cargo for all the purchases. For that reason the governor divides the
cargo-room among all the shippers, according to their wealth <a id="d0e3594"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3594">187</a>]</span>and merits, after they have been examined by intelligent men, appointed for that purpose. Consequently every man knows from
his share how much he can export, and only that amount is received in the vessel; and careful and exact account is taken of
it. Trustworthy persons are appointed who are present at the lading; and space is left for the provisions and passengers that
are to go in the vessels. When the ships are laden and ready to sail, they are delivered to the general and the officials
who have them in charge. Then they start on their voyage at the end of the month of June, with the first vendavals.

</p>
<p>This trade and commerce is so great and profitable, and easy to control&#8212;for it only lasts three months in the year, from the
time of the arrival of the ships with their merchandise, until those vessels that go to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a take that merchandise&#8212;that
the Spaniards do not apply themselves to, or engage in, any other industry. Consequently, there is no husbandry or field-labor
worthy of consideration. Neither do the Spaniards work the gold mines or placers, which are numerous. They do not engage in
many other industries that they could turn to with great profit, if the Chinese trade should fail them. That trade has been
very hurtful and prejudicial in this respect, as well as for the occupations and farm industries in which the natives used
to engage. Now the latter are abandoning and forgetting those labors. Besides, there is the great harm and loss resulting
from the immense amount of silver that passes annually by this way [of the trade], into the possession of infidels, which
can never, by any way, return into the possession of the Spaniards.

</p>
<p>His Majesty&#8217;s agents for the government and justice, <a id="d0e3600"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3600">188</a>]</span>and the royal officials for the management of his Majesty&#8217;s revenue, are as follows: First, the governor and captain-general
of all the islands, who is at the same time president of the royal Audiencia of Manila. He has a salary of eight thousand
pesos de minas per year for all his offices.<a id="d0e3602src" href="#d0e3602" class="noteref">243</a> He possesses his own body-guard of twelve halberdiers, whose captain receives three hundred pesos per year. The governor
alone provides and regulates all that pertains to war and government, with the advice of the auditors of the Audiencia in
difficult matters. He tries in the first instance the criminal cases of the regular soldiers, and any appeals from his decisions
go to the Audiencia.<a id="d0e3608src" href="#d0e3608" class="noteref">244</a> The governor appoints many alcaldes-mayor, corregidors, deputies, and other magistrates, throughout the islands and their
provinces, for carrying on the government and justice, and for military matters. These appointments are made before a government
chief scrivener appointed by his Majesty, who helps the governor.

</p>
<p><a id="d0e3620"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3620">189</a>]</span>The governor likewise takes part with the royal Audiencia, as its president, in whatever pertains to its duties. The Audiencia
consists of four auditors and one fiscal&#8212;each of whom receives an annual salary of two thousand pesos de minas<a id="d0e3622src" href="#d0e3622" class="noteref">245</a>&#8212;one reporter, one court scrivener, one alguacil-mayor, with his assistants, one governor of the prison of the court, one
chancellor, one registrar, two bailiffs, one chaplain and sacristan, one executioner, attorneys, and receivers. The Audiencia
tries all causes, civil and criminal, taken to it from all the provinces of its district.<a id="d0e3628src" href="#d0e3628" class="noteref">246</a> These include the Filipinas Islands and the mainland of China, already discovered or to be discovered. The Audiencia has
the same authority as the chanciller&iacute;as of Valladolid and Granada in Espa&ntilde;a. At the same time, the Audiencia provides whatever
is advisable for the proper and systematic management of the royal exchequer.

</p>
<p>His Majesty&#8217;s revenues in the Filipinas Islands are in charge of and their tribunal consists of three royal officials. They
are appointed by his Majesty, and consist of a factor, an accountant, and a treasurer. They each receive an annual salary
of five hundred and ten thousand maravedis. They have their clerk of mines, and registrars of the royal revenues, and their
executive and other officials, all of whom reside <a id="d0e3635"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3635">190</a>]</span>in Manila. From that city they manage and attend to everything pertaining to the royal revenues throughout the islands.

</p>
<p>His Majesty has a number of encomiendas apportioned to his royal crown throughout the provinces of the Filipinas Islands.
The tributes of those encomiendas are collected for his royal treasury by his royal officials and the collectors engaged for
that purpose by the royal officials. From year to year these amount to thirty thousand pesos, after deducting costs and expenses.
They collect, from one year to another, eight thousand pesos in tributes from the Sangleys&#8212;both Christians and infidels.<a id="d0e3639src" href="#d0e3639" class="noteref">247</a>

</p>
<p>They also collect the fifth of all gold dug in the islands. By special concession for a limited period, the tenth is collected
instead of the fifth. There is a declaration concerning it, to the effect that the natives shall pay no fifths or other duties
on the jewels and gold inherited by them from their ancestors before his Majesty owned the country. Sufficient measures have
been taken for the clear understanding of this concession and its investigation, for that on which the tenth has once been
paid, and the steps to be taken in the matter. From one year to another they collect ten thousand pesos from these fifths,
for much is concealed.<a id="d0e3647src" href="#d0e3647" class="noteref">248</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e3654"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3654">191</a>]</span>The assignment of two reals from each tributario inures to the royal treasury and is paid into it, for the pay of the soldiers
and the stipend of the prebendaries. These are collected from the encomenderos, in proportion to, and on the account of, their
tributes, and amount annually to thirty-four thousand pesos.

</p>
<p>The fines and expenses of justice are committed to the care of the treasurer of the royal revenues, and are kept in the treasury.
They amount annually to three thousand pesos.

</p>
<p>The three per cent duties on the Chinese merchandise of the Sangley vessels average forty thousand pesos annually.<a id="d0e3660src" href="#d0e3660" class="noteref">249</a>

</p>
<p>The two per cent duties paid by the Spaniards for exporting merchandise to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a amount annually to twenty thousand
pesos. On the merchandise and money sent from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a to the Filipinas, result eight thousand pesos more. Consequently,
in these things and in other dues of less importance that belong to the royal treasury, his Majesty receives about one hundred
and fifty thousand pesos, or thereabout, annually in the Filipinas.<a id="d0e3668src" href="#d0e3668" class="noteref">250</a>

</p>
<p>Inasmuch as this amount does not suffice for the expenses that are incurred, the royal treasury of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a sends annually
to that of the Filipinas, in addition to the above revenues, some assistance in money&#8212;a greater or less sum, as necessity
requires. For his Majesty has thus provided for it from the proceeds of the ten per cent duties on the Chinese merchandise
that are collected at the port of Acapulco <a id="d0e3676"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3676">192</a>]</span>in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. This assistance is given into the keeping of the royal officials in Manila, and they take charge of it, with
the rest of the revenues that they manage and collect.

</p>
<p>From all this gross sum of his Majesty&#8217;s revenue, the salaries of the governor and royal Audiencia are paid, as well as the
stipends of prelates and ecclesiastical prebendaries, the salaries of the magistrates, and of the royal officials and their
assistants; the pay of all the military officers and regular soldiers; his Majesty&#8217;s share of the stipends for instruction,
and the building of churches and their ornaments; the concessions and gratifications that he has allowed to certain monasteries,
and private persons; the building of large vessels for the navigation to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and of galleys and other vessels for
the defense of the islands; expenses for gunpowder and ammunition; the casting of artillery, and its care; the expense arising
for expeditions and individual undertakings in the islands, and in their defense; that of navigations to, and negotiations
with, the kingdoms in their vicinity, which are quite common and necessary. Consequently, since his Majesty&#8217;s revenues in
these islands are so limited, and his expenses so great, the royal treasury falls short, and suffers poverty and need.<a id="d0e3680src" href="#d0e3680" class="noteref">251</a>

</p>
<p>The proceeds from the ten per cent duties and the freight charges of the ships, which are collected at Acapulco in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a,
on the merchandise sent <a id="d0e3688"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3688">193</a>]</span>there from the Filipinas, although considerable, are also not always sufficient for the expenses incurred in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a
with the ships, soldiers, ammunition, and other supplies sent annually to the Filipinas. These expenses are generally greatly
in excess of those duties, and the amount is made up from the royal treasury of Mexico. Consequently, the king our sovereign
derives as yet no profit from any revenues of the Filipinas, but rather an expenditure, by no means small, from his revenues
in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. He sustains the Filipinas only for the christianization and conversion of the natives, and for the hopes
of greater fruits in other kingdoms and provinces of Asia, which are expected through this gateway, at God&#8217;s good pleasure.

</p>
<p>Every year the Audiencia audits the accounts of the royal officials of his Majesty&#8217;s revenues, strikes the balances, and sends
the accounts to the tribunal of accounts in Mexico.<a id="d0e3692src" href="#d0e3692" class="noteref">252</a>

</p>
<p><a id="d0e3709"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3709">194</a>]</span>In the city of Manila, and in all those Spanish settlements of the islands, reside Sangleys, who have come from Great China,
besides the merchants. They have appointed settlements and are engaged in various trades, and go to the islands for their
livelihood. Some possess their pari&aacute;ns and shops. Some engage in fishing and farming among the natives, throughout the country;
and go from one island to another to trade, in large or small champans.<a id="d0e3711src" href="#d0e3711" class="noteref">253</a>

</p>
<p>The annual vessels from Great China bring these Sangleys in great numbers, especially to the city of Manila, for the sake
of the profits that are gained from their fares. As there is a superabundance of population in China, and the wages and profits
there are little, they regard as of importance whatever they get in the Filipinas.

</p>
<p>Very great annoyances result from this; for, not only can there be little security to the country with so many infidels, but
the Sangleys are a wicked and <a id="d0e3721"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3721">195</a>]</span>vicious race. Through intercourse and communication with them, the natives improve little in Christianity and morals. And
since they come in such numbers and are so great eaters, they raise the price of provisions, and consume them.

</p>
<p>It is true that the city could not be maintained or preserved without these Sangleys; for they are the mechanics in all trades,
and are excellent workmen and work for suitable prices. But a less number of them would suffice for this, and would avoid
the inconvenience of so many people as are usually in Manila when the ships arrive&#8212;to say nothing of the many Chinese who
go about among the islands, under pretext of trading with the natives, and there commit innumerable crimes and offenses. At
the least, they explore all the country, the rivers, creeks, and ports, and know them better than the Spaniards do; and they
will be of great harm and injury in case of any revolt or hostile invasion of the islands.

</p>
<p>In order to remedy all the above, it was ordered that the vessels should not bring so many people of this kind, under penalties
that are executed; that, when the vessels return to China, they take these Sangleys back with them; that only a convenient
number of merchants remain in Manila, in the Pari&aacute;n, and the mechanics of all necessary trades; and that these must have written
license, under severe penalties. In the execution of this, an auditor of the Audiencia is engaged by special commission every
year, together with some assistants. On petition of the city cabildo, he usually allows as many Sangleys to remain as are
necessary for the service of all trades and occupations. The rest are embarked and compelled to return in the vessels going
to China, and a <a id="d0e3727"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3727">196</a>]</span>great deal of force and violence<a id="d0e3729src" href="#d0e3729" class="noteref">254</a> is necessary to accomplish it.

</p>
<p>Those merchants and artisans who remained in Manila before the revolt of the year six hundred and three had settled the Pari&aacute;n
and its shops. The Pari&aacute;n is a large enclosed alcaicer&iacute;a of many streets, at some distance from the city walls. It is near
the river, and its location is called San Graviel. There they have their own governor, who has his tribunal and prison, and
his assistants; these administer justice to them, and watch them day and night, so that they may live in security, and not
commit disorders.

</p>
<p>Those who cannot find room in this Pari&aacute;n live opposite, on the other side of the river, where Tondo is, in two settlements
called Baybay and Minondoc. They are in charge of the alcalde-mayor of Tondo, and under the ministry of the religious of St.
Dominic, who labor for their conversion, and for that purpose have learned the Chinese language.

</p>
<p>The Dominicans have two monasteries with the requisite assistants, and a good hospital for the treatment of Sangleys. In a
district kept separate from the infidels, they have a settlement of baptized Sangleys, with their wives, households, and families,
numbering five hundred inhabitants; and the religious are continually baptizing others and settling them in that village.
But few of them turn out well, for they are a vile and restless race, with many vices and bad customs. Their having become
Christians is not through the desire or wish for salvation, but for the temporal conveniences that they have there, and because
some are unable to return to China because of debts incurred and crimes committed there.

</p>
<p><a id="d0e3744"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3744">197</a>]</span>Each and all, both Christians and infidels, go unarmed and in their national garb. This consists of long garments with wide
sleeves, made of blue cangan (but white for mourning, while the chief men wear them of black and colored silks); wide drawers
of the same material; half hose of felt; very broad shoes, according to their fashion, made of blue silk embroidered with
braid&#8212;with several soles, well-sewed&#8212;and of other stuffs. Their hair is long and very black, and they take good care of it.
They do it up on the head in a high knot,<a id="d0e3746src" href="#d0e3746" class="noteref">255</a> under a very close-fitting hood or coif of horsehair, which reaches to the middle of the forehead. They wear above all a
high round cap made of the same horsehair, in different fashions, by which their different occupations, and each man&#8217;s rank,
are distinguished. The Christians differ only in that they cut their hair short, and wear hats, as do the Spaniards.

</p>
<p>They are a light-complexioned people and tall of body. They have scant beards, are very stout-limbed, and of great strength.
They are excellent workmen, and skilful in all arts and trades. They are phlegmatic, of little courage, treacherous and cruel
when opportunity offers, and very covetous. They are heavy eaters of all kinds of meat, fish, and fruits; but they drink sparingly,
and then of hot beverages.

</p>
<p>They have a governor of their own race, a Christian, who has his officials and assistants. He hears their cases in affairs
of justice, in their domestic and business affairs. Appeals from him go to the alcalde-mayor of Tondo or of the Pari&aacute;n, and
from all these to the Audiencia, which also gives especial attention to this nation and whatever pertains to it.

</p>
<p><a id="d0e3754"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3754">198</a>]</span>No Sangley can live or own a house outside these settlements of the Pari&aacute;n, and of Baybay and Minondoc. Native settlements
are not allowed in Sangley settlements, or even near them. No Sangley can go among the islands, or as much as two leguas from
the city, without special permission. Much less can he remain in the city at night, after the gates are shut, under penalty
of death.

</p>
<p>There are generally some Japanese, both Christian and infidel, in Manila. These are left by the vessels from Japon, although
they are not so numerous as the Chinese. They have their special settlement and location outside the city, between the Sangley
Pari&aacute;n and the suburb of Laguio, near the monastery of La Candelaria. There they are directed by discalced religious of St.
Francis, by means of interpreters whom the fathers keep for that purpose. They are a spirited race, of good disposition, and
brave. They wear their own costume, namely, kimonos of colored silks and cotton, reaching half way down the leg, and open
in front; wide, short drawers; close-fitting half-boots of leather,<a id="d0e3758src" href="#d0e3758" class="noteref">256</a> and shoes like sandals, with the soles of well-woven straw. They go bare-headed, and shave the top of the head as far back
as the crown. Their back hair is long, and fastened upon the skull in a graceful knot. They carry their catans, large and
small, in the belt. They have scant beards, and are a race of noble bearing and behavior. They employ many ceremonies and
courtesies, and attach much importance to honor and social standing. They are resolute in any necessity or danger.

</p>
<p>Those who become Christians prove very good, and are very devout and observant in their religion; <a id="d0e3769"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3769">199</a>]</span>for only the desire for salvation incites them to adopt our religion, so that there are many Christians in Japon. Accordingly
they return freely, and without opposition, to their own country. At most there are about five hundred Japanese of this nation
in Manila, for they do not go to other parts of the islands, and such is their disposition that they return to Japon, and
do not tarry in the islands; consequently very few of them usually remain in the islands. They are treated very cordially,
as they are a race that demand good treatment, and it is advisable to do so for the friendly relations between the islands
and Japon.<a id="d0e3771src" href="#d0e3771" class="noteref">257</a>

</p>
<p>Few people come from the other nations&#8212;Sian, Camboja, Borneo, Patan, and other islands&#8212;outside our government; and they immediately
return in their vessels. Consequently, there is nothing special to be said of them, except that care is exercised in receiving
and despatching them well, and seeing that they return quickly to their own countries.

<p>Since I have told, in the short time at my disposal, the characteristics of the Filipinas Islands, and their customs and practices,
it will not be inappropriate to discuss the navigation to them since it is made thither from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a; the return voyage,
which is not short, or without great dangers and hardships; and that made in the eastern direction.

</p>
<p>When the islands were conquered in the year of <a id="d0e3783"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3783">200</a>]</span>one thousand five hundred and seventy-four [<i>sic; sc</i>. 1564], the Spanish fleet sailed under command of the adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, from Puerto de la Navidad<a id="d0e3788src" href="#d0e3788" class="noteref">258</a> situated in the South Sea, on the coast of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, in the province and district of Xalisco and Galicia, where resides
the royal Audiencia of Guadalajara. A few later voyages were made also from the same port, until the point for the sending
of these vessels was removed, for better and greater convenience, to the port of Acapulco, located farther south on the same
coast, in sixteen and one-half degrees of latitude; it is eighty leguas from Mexico, and in its district. It is an excellent
port, sheltered from all weather; and has a good entrance and good anchorages. Its vicinity is advantageous, being better
provisioned and more populous than that of La Navidad. There a large Spanish colony has been established, with its alcalde-mayor,
and royal officials who have charge of his Majesty&#8217;s treasury; and these attend to the despatch of the vessels.

</p>
<p>The vessels that sail to the Filipinas, as they are despatched annually on his Majesty&#8217;s account, must necessarily leave in
the certain season of the brisas, which begin in the month of November and last until the end of March. This navigation should
not be made at any other season, for from June the vendavals blow, and they are contrary to the voyage.

</p>
<p>As a rule, these ships sail and are despatched at the end of February, or at the latest by the twentieth of March. They sail
west toward the islands of <a id="d0e3795"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3795">201</a>]</span>Las Velas,<a id="d0e3797src" href="#d0e3797" class="noteref">259</a> otherwise called the Ladrones. The island of Guan, one of them, lies in thirteen degrees of latitude. Inasmuch as the vessels
on leaving Acapulco are wont sometimes to encounter calms, they sail south from sixteen and one-half degrees, in which the
port is situated, until they strike the brisas, which is generally at ten or eleven degrees. By this route they sail continually
before the wind, and without changing the sails, with fresh and fair brisas, and in other moderate weather, for one thousand
eight hundred leguas, without sighting any mainland or island. Then leaving to the south the Barbudos and other islands, and
advancing gradually to a latitude of thirteen degrees, they sail until they sight the island of Guan; and above it, in fourteen
degrees, that of La &Ccedil;arpana [Seypan]. This voyage to those Ladrones Islands lasts generally seventy days.

</p>
<p>The natives of those islands, who go naked, and are a very robust and barbarous race, go out to sea to meet the ships as soon
as they discover them, at a distance of four to six leguas, with many vessels; these are one-masted, and are very slender
and light. These vessels have a counterpoise of bamboo to leeward, and their sails are made of palm-leaves and are lateen-sails.
Two or three men go in each one with oars and paddles. They carry loads of flying-fish, dorados,<a id="d0e3805src" href="#d0e3805" class="noteref">260</a> cocoa-nuts, bananas, sweet potatoes, bamboos full of water, and certain mats; and when they reach the ships, they trade these
for iron from <a id="d0e3811"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3811">202</a>]</span>the hoops of casks, and bundles of nails, which they use in their industries, and in the building of their ships. Since some
Spaniards and religious have lived among them, because of Spanish ships being wrecked or obliged to take refuge there, they
come more freely to our ships and enter them.

</p>
<p>Our ships sail between the two islands of Guan and &Ccedil;arpana toward the Filipinas and the cape of Espiritu Santo, a distance
of three hundred leguas farther on, in the latitude of about thirteen degrees. This distance is made in ten or twelve days
with the brisas; but it may happen, if the ships sail somewhat late, that they encounter vendavals, which endanger their navigation,
and they enter the islands after great trouble and stormy weather.

</p>
<p>From the cape of Espiritu Santo, the ships enter the strait of Capul at the islands of Mazbate and Burias; thence they sail
to Marinduque and the coast of Calilaya, the strait of Mindoro, the shoals of Tuley, and the mouth of Manila Bay. Thence,
they go to the port of Cabit. This is a voyage of one hundred leguas from the entrance to the islands and is made in one week.
This is the end of the voyage, which is good and generally without storms, if made in the proper time.

</p>
<p>These vessels now make the return voyage from the Filipinas to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a with great difficulty and danger, for the course
is a long one and there are many storms and various temperatures. The ships depart, on this account, very well supplied with
provisions, and suitably equipped. Each one sails alone, hoisting as much sail as possible, and one does not wait for the
other, nor do they sight one another during the voyage.

</p>
<p><a id="d0e3820"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3820">203</a>]</span>They leave the bay and port of Cabit at the first setting-in of the vendavals, between the same islands and by the same straits,
by the twentieth of June and later. As they set out amid showers, and are among islands, they sail with difficulty until they
leave the channel at Capul. Once in the open sea, they catch the vendaval, and voyage east, making more progress when they
reach the latitude of fourteen or fifteen degrees.

</p>
<p>Then the brisa starts. This wind is the ordinary one in the South Sea, especially in low latitudes. Since it is a head wind,
the course is changed, and the bow is pointed betwen the north and east, as much as the wind will allow. With this they reach
a higher latitude, and the ship is kept in this course until the vendaval returns. Then, by means of it, the ship again takes
an eastern course in that latitude where it happens to be, and keeps that direction as long as that wind lasts. When the vendaval
dies, the ship takes the best course that the winds allow, by the winds then blowing between north and east. If the wind is
so contrary that it is north or northwest, so that the ship cannot take that course, the other course is taken so that they
may continue to maintain their voyage without losing time. At four hundred leguas from the islands they sight certain volcanoes
and ridges of the islands of Ladrones, which run north as far as twenty-four degrees.<a id="d0e3824src" href="#d0e3824" class="noteref">261</a> Among these they generally encounter severe storms and whirl-winds. <a id="d0e3827"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3827">204</a>]</span>At thirty-four degrees is the cape of Sestos,<a id="d0e3829src" href="#d0e3829" class="noteref">262</a> at the northern head of Japon, six hundred leguas from the Filipinas. They sail among other islands, which are rarely seen,
in thirty-eight degrees, encountering the same dangers and storms, and in a cold climate, in the neighborhood of the islands
Rica de Oro [&#8220;rich in gold&#8221;] and Rica de Plata [&#8220;rich in silver&#8221;], which are but seldom seen.<a id="d0e3835src" href="#d0e3835" class="noteref">263</a> After passing them the sea and open expanse of water is immense, and the ship can run free in any weather. This gulf is traversed
for many leguas with such winds as are encountered, until a latitude of forty-two degrees is reached, toward the coast of
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. They seek the winds that generally prevail at so high a latitude, which are usually northwest. After a long
voyage the coast of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a is sighted, and from Cape Mendo&ccedil;ino (which lies in forty-two and one-half degrees) the coast
extends nine hundred leguas to the port of Acapulco, which lies in sixteen and one-half degrees.

</p>
<p>When the ships near the coast, which they generally sight betwen forty and thirty-six degrees, the cold is very severe, and
the people suffer and die. Three hundred leguas before reaching land, signs of it are seen, by certain <i>aguas malas</i>,<a id="d0e3855src" href="#d0e3855" class="noteref">264</a> as large as the <a id="d0e3858"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3858">205</a>]</span>hand, round and violet colored, with a crest in the middle like a lateen sail, which are called <i>caravelas</i> [&#8220;caravels&#8221;]. This sign lasts until the ship is one hundred leguas from land; and then are discovered certain fish, with
half the body in the form of a dog;<a id="d0e3863src" href="#d0e3863" class="noteref">265</a> these frolic with one another near the ship. After these <i>perrillos</i> [&#8220;little dogs&#8221;] are seen the <i>porras</i> [&#8220;knobsticks&#8221;], which are certain very long, hollow shoots of a yellow herb with a ball at the top, and which float on the
water. At thirty leguas from the coast are seen many great bunches of grass which are carried down to the sea by the great
rivers of the country. These grasses are called <i>balsas</i> [&#8220;rafts or floats&#8221;]. Also many perrillos are seen, and, in turn, all the various signs. Then the coast is discovered, and
it is very high and clear land. Without losing sight of land, the ship coasts along it with the northwest, north-northwest,
and north winds, which generally prevail on that coast, blowing by day toward the land, and by night toward the sea again.
With the decrease of the latitude and the entrance into a warm climate the island of Cenizas [ashes] is seen, and afterward
that of Cedros [cedars]. Thence one sails until the cape of San Lucas is sighted, which is the entrance of [the gulf of] California.
From that one traverses the eighty leguas intervening to the islands of Las Marias and the cape of Corrientes [&#8220;currents&#8221;],
which is on the other side of California in Val de Vanderas [&#8220;valley of banners&#8221;], and the provinces of Chametla. Thence one
passes the coast of Colima, Sacatul, Los Motines [&#8220;the mutinies&#8221;], and Ciguatanejo, and enters the port of Acapulco&#8212;without
having <a id="d0e3875"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3875">206</a>]</span>made a way-station or touched land from the channel of Capul in the Filipinas throughout the voyage. The voyage usually lasts
five months or thereabout, but often six and even more.<a id="d0e3877src" href="#d0e3877" class="noteref">266</a>

</p>
<p>By way of India, one may sail from the Filipinas to Espa&ntilde;a, by making the voyage to Malaca, and thence to Cochin and Goa,
a distance of one thousand two hundred leguas. This voyage must be made with the brisas. From Goa one sails by way of India
to the cape of Buena Esperan&ccedil;a [Good Hope], and to the Terceras [<i>i.e.</i>, Azores] Islands, and thence to Portugal and the port of Lisboa. This is a very long and dangerous voyage, as is experienced
by the Portuguese who make it every year. From India they usually send letters and despatches to Espa&ntilde;a by way of the Bermejo
[&#8220;Red&#8221;] Sea, by means of Indians. These send them through Arabia to Alexandria, and thence by sea to Venecia [Venice] and
thence to Espa&ntilde;a.

</p>
<p>A galleon bound for Portugal sails and is despatched from the fort of Malaca, in certain years, by the open sea, without touching
at India or on its coasts. It reaches Lisboa much more quickly than do the Goa vessels. It generally sails on the fifth of
January, and does not leave later than that; nor <a id="d0e3890"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3890">209</a>]</span>does it usually anticipate that date. However, not any of these voyages are practiced by the Castilians&#8212;who are prohibited
from making them&#8212;except the one made by way of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, both going and coming, as above described. And although the effort
has been made, no better or shorter course has been found by way of the South Sea.<a id="d0e3892src" href="#d0e3892" class="noteref">267</a>

Philippines. After spending many years as a missionary in Luz&oacute;n and Mindoro, he was elected provincial of his order in the islands (in 1599, and again in 1608). Going to Japan as commissary
provincial&#8212;in 1603, according to Morga, but 1604 as given by Huerta (<i>Estado</i>, p. 446)&#8212;he was obliged by severe illness to return to Manila; he died there on December 12, 1609.

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="d0e292" href="#d0e292src" class="noteref">4</a></span> Luis Sotelo, belonging to an illustrious family of Sevilla, made his profession as a Franciscan in 1594. Joining the Philippine
mission, he reached the islands in 1600; and he spent the next two years in ministering to the Japanese near Manila, and in
the study of their language. In 1600 he went to Japan, where he zealously engaged in missionary labors. Ten years later, he
was sentenced to death for preaching the Christian religion; but was freed from this danger by Mazamune, king of Boxu, who
sent the Franciscan as his ambassador to Rome and Madrid. Returning from this mission, Sotelo arrived in the Philippines in
1618, and four years later resumed his missionary labors in Japan. In 1622 he was again imprisoned for preaching, and was
confined at Omura for two years, during which time he wrote several works, in both the Spanish and Japanese languages. Sotelo
was finally burned at the stake in Omura, August 25, 1624. See Huerta&#8217;s <i>Estado</i>, pp. 392&#8211;394.

</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="d0e404" href="#d0e404src" class="noteref">16</a></span> In this struggle many cruelties were committed and many quiet and friendly Chinese killed. Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a, who could not
prevent or stifle this terrible insurrection in its beginnings, also contributed to the horrible butcheries that ensued. &#8220;Accordingly
many Spaniards and natives went to hunt the disbanded Sangleys, at Don Pedro&#8217;s order.&#8221; Hernando de Avalos, alcalde of La Pampanga,
seized more than 400 pacific Sangleys, &#8220;and leading them to an estuary, manacled two and two, delivered them to certain Japanese,
who killed them. Father Fray Diego de Guevara of the order of St. Augustine, prior of Manila, who made this relation, preached
to the Sangleys first, but only five abandoned their idolatry.&#8221; ... Would he not have done better to preach to Alcalde Avalos,
and to remind him that he was a man? The Spanish historians say that the Japanese and Filipinos showed themselves cruel in
the killing of the Chinese. It is quite probable, considering the rancor and hate with which they were regarded. But their
commanders contributed to it also by their example. It is said that more than 23,000 Chinese were killed. &#8220;Some assert that
the number of Sangleys killed was greater, but in order that the illegality committed in allowing so many to enter the country
contrary to the royal prohibitions might not be known, the officials covered up or diminished the number of those who perished&#8221;

industry and agriculture of the country. The terrible competition of the Chinese with any individual of another race is well
known, for which reason the United States and Australia refuse to admit them. The indolence, then, of the inhabitants of the
Filipinas, is derived from the lack of foresight of the government. Argensola says the same thing, and could not have copied
Morga, since their works were published in the same year, in countries very distant from one another, and the two contain
wide differences.&#8212;<span class="smallcaps">Rizal</span>.

<p class="footnote">The Chinese question has always been of great importance in the Philippines. The dislike of the Filipino for the Chinese seemed
instinctive and was deep-rooted. The subject of the Chinese immigration to the islands has served for special legislation
on many occasions in Spain, but they have nevertheless persisted in their trading and occupations therein. See Stanley&#8217;s edition
of Morga, appendix II, pp. 363&#8211;368; and <i>Los Chinos en Filipinos</i> (Manila, 1886).

attributes its good outcome to the cleverness of the former. What was then believed to be prudent resulted afterward as an
impolitic measure, and bore very fatal consequences; for it aroused the hostility of all the Molucas, even that of their allies,
and made the Spanish name as odious as was the Portuguese. The priest Hernando de los Rios, Bokemeyer, and other historians,
moreover, accuse Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a of bad faith in this; but, strictly judged, we believe that they do so without foundation.
Don Pedro in his passport assured the lives of the king and prince, but not their liberty. Doubtless a trifle more generosity
would have made the conqueror greater, and the odium of the Spanish name less, while it would have assured Spanish domination
of that archipelago. The unfortunate king never returned to his own country. Hernando de los Rios says that during Don Pedro
de Acu&ntilde;a&#8217;s life he was well treated, but that during the administration of Don Juan de Silva &#8220;I have seen him in a poor lodging
where all the rain fell on him, and they were starving him to death.&#8221; He is described by Argensola as of &#8220;robust proportions,
and his limbs are well formed. His neck and much of his breast are bare. His flesh is of a cloudy color, rather black than
gray. The features of his face are like those of an European. His eyes are large and full, and he seems to dart sparks from
them. His large eyelashes, his thick bristling beard, and his mustaches add to his fierceness. He always wears his campilan,
dagger, and kris, both with hilts in the form of gilded serpents&#8217; heads.&#8221; This description was taken from a picture sent to

and most of those making it killed. &#8220;This report, having come to the ears of the Indians, was so harmful that they began to
mutiny, especially in the provinces of Camarines and Pintados. The friars who instructed them could already do, nothing with
them, for they asked why, since the inhabitants of the Malucos were victorious, should they be subject to the Spaniards, who did not defend them from the Moros. They said that the Moros would plunder them daily with the help of Ternate, and that
it would be worse henceforth&#8221; (Argensola).&#8212;<span class="smallcaps">Rizal</span>.

<p class="footnote">[Note: Inasmuch as Morga enters somewhat largely into the ancient customs of the Tag&aacute;ls and other Filipino peoples in the
present chapter, and as some of Rizal&#8217;s notes indicative of the ancient culture of those peoples are incorporated in notes
that follow, we deem it advisable to invite attention to Lord Stanley&#8217;s remarks in the preface to his translation of Morga
(p. vii), and Pardo de Tavera&#8217;s comment in his <i>Biblioteca Filipina</i> (Washington, 1903), p. 276. Stanley says: &#8220;The inhabitants of the Philippines previous to the Spanish settlement were not like the inhabitants of the great Indian Peninsula, people with a civilization
as that of their conquerors. Excepting that they possessed the art of writing, and an alphabet of their own, they do not appear
to have differed in any way from the Dayaks of Borneo as described by Mr. Boyle in his recent book of adventures amongst that
people. Indeed there is almost a coincidence of verbal expressions in the descriptions he and De Morga give of the social
customs, habits, and superstitions of the two peoples they are describing; though many of these coincidences are such as are
incidental to life in similar circumstances, there are enough to lead one to suppose a community of origin of the inhabitants
of Borneo and Luzon.&#8221; Pardo de Tavera says after quoting the first part of the above: &#8220;Lord Stanley&#8217;s opinion is dispassionate
and not at all at variance with historical truth.&#8221; The same author says also that Blumentritt&#8217;s prologue and Rizal&#8217;s notes
in the latter&#8217;s edition of Morga have so aroused the indignation of the Spaniards that several have even attacked Morga.]

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="d0e775" href="#d0e775src" class="noteref">41</a></span> We confess our ignorance with respect to the origin of this belief of Morga, which, as one can observe, was not his belief
in the beginning of the first chapter. Already from the time of Diodorus Siculus (first century B. C.), Europe received information
of these islands by one Iamboule, a Greek, who went to them (to Sumatra at least), and who wrote afterward the relation of
his voyage. He gave therein detailed information of the number of the islands, of their inhabitants, of their writing, navigation,
etc. Ptolemy mentions three islands in his geography, which are called Sind&aelig; in the Latin text. They are inhabited by the
<span class="Greek">&#945;&#947;&#953;&#957;&#957;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>. Mercator interprets those islands as Celebes, Gilolo, and Amboina. Ptolemy also mentions the island <span class="Greek">&#945;&#947;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#965; &#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> (Borneo), five <span class="Greek">&#946;&#945;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#953;</span> (Mindanao, Leite, Sebu, etc.), three <span class="Greek">&#963;&#945;&#946;&#945;&#948;&#949;&#8217;&#953;&#946;&#945;&#953;</span> (the Java group&#8212;<span class="Greek">&#953;&#945;&#946;&#945;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#965;</span>) and ten <span class="Greek">&#956;&#945;&#963;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#955;&#945;&#953;</span> where a large loadstone was found. Colin surmises that these are the Manilas.&#8212;<span class="smallcaps">Rizal</span>.

Colin (<i>Labor Evangelica</i>, Madrid, 1663) discusses the discovery and naming of the Philippines. He quotes Ptolemy&#8217;s passage that speaks of islands
called the Maniolas, whence many suppose came the name Manilas, sometimes given to the islands. But as pointed out in a letter
dated March 14, 1904, by James A. LeRoy, Spanish writers have wasted more time on the question than it merits. Mr. LeRoy probably
conjectures rightly that many old Chinese and Japanese documents will be found to contain matter relating to the Philippines
prior to the Spanish conquest.
</p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="d0e806" href="#d0e806src" class="noteref">42</a></span> It is very difficult now to determine exactly which is this island of Tendaya, called Isla Filipina for some years. According
to Father Urdaneta&#8217;s relations, this island was far to the east of the group, past the meridian of Maluco. Mercator locates
it in Panay, and Colin in Leyte, between Abuyog and Cabal&iacute;an&#8212;contrary to the opinion of others, who locate it in Ibabao, or
south of Samar. But according to other documents of that period, there is no island by that name, but a chief called Tendaya,
lord of a village situated in that district; and, as the Spaniards did not understand the Indians well at that time, many
contradictions thus arose in the relations of that period. We see that, in Legazpi&#8217;s expedition, while the Spaniards talked
of islands, the Indians talked of a man, etc. After looking for Tandaya for ten days they had to continue without finding
it &#8220;and we passed on without seeing Tandaya or Abuyo.&#8221; It appears, nevertheless, that the Spaniards continued to give this
name to the southwestern part of Samar, calling the southeastern part Ibabao or Zibabao and the northern part of the same
island Samar.&#8212;<span class="smallcaps">Rizal</span>.

and prowess. No one was allowed to use the red potong until he had killed at least one man. And in order to wear them edged
with certain edgings, which were regarded as a crown, they must have killed seven men&#8221; (Colin). Even now any Indian is seen

The boats that held one hundred rowers to a side and thirty soldiers have disappeared. The country that once, with primitive
methods, built ships of about 2,000 toneladas, today [1890] has to go to foreign ports, as Hong-Kong, to give the gold wrenched

is perishing, thanks to the obstacles created by a timid and mistrusting system of government; and there scarcely remains

The tree resembles a walnut-tree. Its leaves are rounded and as large as the palm of the hand, and are dark green
in color. Excellent preserves are made from the fruit, which was also eaten raw by the Indians. The leaves of the tree have
medicinal properties and were used as poultices. <i>Mabolo</i> (<i>Diospyros discolor</i>&#8212;Willd.) signifies in Tag&aacute;l a thing or fruit enclosed in a soft covering. The tree is not very high. The leaves are large, and incline to a red color when old.
The fruit is red and as large as a medium-sized quince, and has several large stones. The inside of the fruit is white, and
is sweet and firm, and fragrant, but not very digestible. The wood resembles ebony, is very lustrous, and is esteemed for
its solidity and hardness. The <i>nanca</i> [<i>nangka</i>, <i>nangca</i>; translated by Stanley, jack-fruit] (<i>Artocarpus integrifolia</i>&#8212;Willd.), was taken to the Philippines from India, where it was called <i>yaca</i>. The tree is large and wide-spreading, and has long narrow leaves. It bears fruit not only on the branches, but on the trunk
and roots. The fruit is gathered when ripe, at which time it exhales an aromatic odor. On opening it a yellowish or whitish
meat is found, which is not edible. But in this are found certain yellow stones, with a little kernel inside resembling a
large bean; this is sweet, like the date, but has a much stronger odor. It is indigestible, and when eaten should be well
masticated. The shells are used in cooking and resemble chestnuts. The wood is yellow, solid, and especially useful in making
certain musical instruments. Buzeta and Bravo (<i>Diccionario</i>, i, p. 35) say that there are more than fifty-seven species of bananas in the Philippines.

Delgado (<i>ut supra</i>) says that this was one of the most notable and useful fruits of the islands. It was generally confined to mountainous regions
and grew wild. The natives used the fruit and extracted a white pitch from the tree. The fruit has a strong, hard shell. The
fruit itself resembles an almond, both in shape and taste, although it is larger. The tree is very high, straight, and wide-spreading.
Its leaves are larger than those of the almond-tree.

The tree is fragrant and has wood of a reddish color. It was used for making the hulls of vessels, because of
its strength and lightness. The same author describes also the <i>asana</i> (<i>Pterocarpus indicus</i>&#8212;Willd.) or as it is called in the Visayas, <i>naga</i> or <i>narra</i>&#8212;as an aromatic tree, of which there are two varieties, male and female. The wood of the male tree is pinkish, while that
of the female tree is inclined to white. They both grow to a great size and are used for work requiring large timber. The
wood has good durable qualities and is very impervious to water, for which reason it was largely used as supports for the
houses. Water in which pieces of the wood were placed, or the water that stood in vessels made of this wood, had a medicinal
value in dropsy and other diseases. In the provinces of Albay and Camarines the natives made curiously-shaped drinking vessels
from this wood.

The same author states also that the tattooing was done little by little and not all at once. &#8220;The children were not tattooed,
but the women tattooed one hand and part of the other. In this island of Manila the Ilocos also tattooed themselves, although
not so much as did the Visayans.&#8221; The Negritos, Igorrotes, and other independent tribes of the Filipinas still tattoo themselves.
The Christians have forgotten the practice. The Filipinas used only the black color, thus differing from the Japanese, who
employ different colors, as red and blue, and carry the art to a rare perfection. In other islands of the Pacific, the women
tattoo themselves almost as much as the men. Dr. Wilhelm Joest&#8217;s <i>T&auml;towiren Narbenzeichnen und K&ouml;rperbemahlen</i> (Berlin, 1887) treats the matter very succinctly.&#8212;<span class="smallcaps">Rizal</span>.

the arrival of the Spaniards. Mas declares that it was horizontal and from left to right, basing his arguments upon certain
documents in the Augustinian archives in Manila. The eminent Filipino scholar, Dr. T. H. Pardo de Tavera has treated the subject

and married into their families. The histories fail to record the assassination for motives of vengeance of any master or
chief by the natives, as they do of encomenderos. After the conquest the evil deepened. The Spaniards made slaves without
these pretexts, and without those enslaved being Indians of their jurisdiction&#8212;going moreover, to take them away from their
own villages and islands. Fernando de los Rios Coronel, in his memorial to the king (Madrid, 1621) pp. 24&#8211;25, speaks in scathing
terms of the cruelties inflicted on the natives in the construction of ships during the governorship of Juan de Silva. A letter from Felipe&nbsp;II to Bishop Domingo de Salazar shows the awful tyranny exercised

that their condition is quite different from that of the slave in Greece or Rome, or that of the negro, and even of those

met very little resistance, while the Filipino chiefs easily lost their independence and liberty. The people, accustomed to
the yoke, did not defend the chiefs from the invader, nor attempt to struggle for liberties that they never enjoyed. For the
people, it was only a change of masters. The nobles, accustomed to tyrannize by force, had to accept the foreign tyranny,
when it showed itself stronger than their own. Not encountering love or elevated feelings in the enslaved mass, they found
themselves without force or power.&#8212;<span class="smallcaps">Rizal</span>.

first obliged to place a bundle of cloth, leaves, or whatever he wished on a pile, in which the thing stolen might be hidden. Upon

sound of this sad music the corpse was washed, and perfumed with storax, gum-resin, or other perfumes made from tree gums,
which are found in all these woods. Then the corpse was shrouded, being wrapped in more or less cloth according to the rank
of the deceased. The bodies of the more wealthy were anointed and embalmed in the manner of the Hebrews, with aromatic liquors,
which preserved them from decay.... The burial-place of the poor was in pits dug in the ground under their own houses. After
the bodies of the rich and powerful were kept and bewailed for three days, they were placed in a chest or coffin of incorruptible
wood, adorned with rich jewels, and with small sheets of gold in the mouth and over the eyes. The coffin was all in one piece,
and the lid was so adjusted that no air could enter. Because of these precautions the bodies have been found after many years,
still uncorrupted. These coffins were deposited in one of three places, according to the inclination and arrangement of the deceased, either on top of the house among the treasures ... or
underneath it, but raised from the ground; or in the ground itself, in an open hole surrounded with a small railing ... nearby
they were wont to place another box filled with the best clothes of the deceased; and at meal-time they set various articles

<p class="footnote">Lieutenant Charles Norton Barney, of the medical department of the U. S. Army, has an article in <i>Journal</i> of the Association of Military Surgeons for September, 1903, on &#8220;Circumcision and Flagellation among the Filipinos.&#8221; In regard
to circumcision he states that it &#8220;is a very ancient custom among the Philippine <i>indios</i>, and so generalized that at least seventy or eighty per cent of males in the <span class="corr" title="Source: Tagal">Tag&aacute;l</span> country have undergone the operation.&#8221; Those uncircumcised at the age of puberty are taunted by their fellows, and such are
called &#8221;<i>suput</i>,&#8221; a word formerly meaning &#8220;constricted&#8221; or &#8220;tight,&#8221; but now being extended to mean &#8220;one who cannot easily gain entrance in
sexual intercourse.&#8221; The &#8220;operation has no religious significance,&#8221; nor is it done for cleanliness, &#8220;but from custom and disinclination
to be ridiculed,&#8221; probably [as Morga proves] having been learned from the Moros. The friars were unable to check the custom. Among the Tag&aacute;ls the operation
is called &#8221;<i>tuli</i>,&#8221; and the method of circumcising is described at length. The author derives his information from a mestizo and a full-blooded
native. The custom is mentioned by Foreman.

to enter was thirteen, among whom was a nephew of Francisco Tello and a son of Dr. Morga. From its inception Latin was taught
there. In a suit with the College of Santo Tom&aacute;s, the Jesuits obtained a favorable decision; and it was recognized as the
older institution, and given the preference in public acts. The historians say that at its inauguration the students wore
bonnets covered with diamonds and pearls. At present [1890] this college, after having moved from house to house, has become
a school of pharmacy attached to Santo Tom&aacute;s, and directed by the Dominican rector.&#8212;<span class="smallcaps">Rizal</span>.

that the increased amount be placed in our royal treasury, and one-half real of it be applied to paying the obligations which
had to be met in regard to the tithes, while the one and one-half reals would remain to pay those soldiers there and for other
purposes; in consideration of the fact that the funds necessary to send out religious, who are employed in the preaching of

from the eight reals, and the part of the building of churches that fell to their share, while the Indians had the choice of paying all the tribute in money or in products, or in both. Thus was it enacted

employed is of wood, unmixed with any metal, and of rude construction. This fabric is stronger than any other of equal fineness,
and its color is unaffected by time or washing. The pieces are generally only 1&frac12; feet wide: the price varies from 1.s. 4d. to

in Ilo-Ilo. The use of this stuff is extensive, and the value is estimated at 500,000 dollars or &pound;120,000; the value of the

leave the fiber; this is washed, dried in the sun, combed out, and classed in four grades according to its fineness. The cloth

are Maria Madre, Maria Magdalena, and Maria Cleofas. Cape Corrientes is south of La Valle de Banderas and Chametla. Socatul

Philippines or China to New Spaine, the which is easie, for that they saile alwaies from East to West neere the line, where
they finde the Easterly windes to blow in their poope. In the yeere 1584, there went a shippe from Callao in Lima to the Philippines,
which sailed 2000 and 700 leagues without sight of land, and the first it discovered was the Iland of Lusson, where they tooke
port, having performed their voiage in two moneths, without want of winde or any torment, and their course was almost continually
vnder the line; ... The returne is like vnto the voiage from the Indies vnto Spaine, for those which returne from the Philippines
or China to Mexico, to the end they may recover the Westerne windes, they mount a great height, vntill they come right against
the Ilands of Iappon, and, discovering the Caliphornes, they returne by the coast of New Spaine to the port of Acapulco.&#8221;

<h3>Conquest of the Malucas Islands</h3>
<p>[The usual licenses and preliminary matter precede Argensola&#8217;s<a id="d0e3936src" href="#d0e3936" class="noteref">1</a> history. The license of the king permitting the author, and no other, to have the book printed and sold for the following
ten years, bears date &#8220;Madrid, January twenty-four, one thousand six hundred and nine.&#8221; The license and approbation of the
ordinary, Doctor Cetina, dated &#8220;Madrid, December 30, 1608,&#8221; certifies that the history contains nothing against the Catholic
faith. Pedro de Valencia, royal chronicler, under date of &#8220;Madrid, January 14, 1609,&#8221; approves the work as deserving publicity.
Licentiate Murcia de la Llana, after comparing a single printed copy with the original manuscript, appends a list of errata,
with certification that, <a id="d0e3948"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3948">218</a>]</span>with these, the book corresponds to the original. This bears date &#8220;Madrid, May 4, 1609.&#8221; Pedro Zapata del Marmol, at &#8220;Madrid,
May seven, one thousand six hundred and nine,&#8221; appraises the book and orders that it be sold at four maravedis per pliego
or fold, thus making the price of the book, since it contains one hundred and six pliegos, twelve reals, sixteen maravedis.
In his dedication, dated &#8220;Madrid, May 4, 1609,&#8221; Argensola requests the king to read his book, as it &#8220;contains victories of
the Church.&#8221; The author&#8217;s brother, Lupercio Leonardo de Argensola, secretary of the empress, chief chronicler of the king
in Arag&oacute;n, writes a letter &#8220;to the readers,&#8221; in which he meets their arguments or supposed arguments, and defends the title
and contents of the book, the method of treatment, the style, and its <i>raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre</i>.

</p>
<p>The work contains ten books, the first four of which consist almost entirely of matters extraneous to the Philippines, such
as Maluco matters, the history of Pedro Sarmiento&#8217;s expedition through the Strait of Magellan in search of Drake, etc. The
last six books contain more Philippine matter, and while Argensola cannot always be credited with the same reliability as
Morga, he often supplements the latter. His introduction in the first book reads as follows:]<a id="d0e3955src" href="#d0e3955" class="noteref">2</a>

</p>
<p>I write of the reduction of the Malucas Islands to the obedience of Felipe III, king of Espa&ntilde;a, and the reduction of their
kings to their former vassalage, which their predecessors rendered, and which was introduced anew by Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a, governor
of the Filipinas and general of the Spanish fleet. <a id="d0e3960"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3960">219</a>]</span>That was a victory worthy the foresight of so pious a monarch, of the care of the dignified ministers of his supreme council,
and of the valor of our nation: not so greatly because of the rare fertility of those provinces, as because by it was taken
from the northern fleets one great compelling motive for sailing our seas, so that they should not infect the purity of the
new faith of the Asiatic Indians, and the inhabitants of our colonies who trade with them, with heresy. The short time in
which the undertaking was completed does not detract from its praise; on the contrary, it can, by that very fact, occupy a
worthy place among more copious narratives. Well do I see the dangers to which I expose myself, but I am also confident that
I shall not find a defense wanting. Illustrious sculptors or painters are wont to esteem highly the heads, arms, and other
members, that are copied perfectly from living bodies, in imitation of which they form all the parts, when they wish to make
any figure. Those ignorant of art despise that preparation, and only enjoy the statue or picture, which is composed of all
its members, and do not examine the imperfections that they may possess. My present relation of the recovery of those kingdoms
will be judged by this esteem and by this contempt. For the wise, who know how history is formed, will esteem this part drawn
from life. Others who read, as they confess, only to pass the time, will value it but little&#8212;preferring some highly fabulous
monstrosities, or a prolix book, which, under the name of history, contains a marvelous number of people, and their deaths;
and which gives events, not as God disposed them, but as they desire them. Hence it happens that many things worth knowing
<a id="d0e3962"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3962">220</a>]</span>remain hidden, for, since they are deferred tor general histories, they are contemporaneously written but meagerly, by those
concerned in them; and when their manuscripts are wanted, they are not to be found, or else bind the writer to the laws imposed
on him by those who wished to leave that memorial through their self-love or any other passion, and he can make no examination
of their truth. Consequently to free a success so important as that of Ternate, the capital of all Maluco, from this danger,
I was ordered to write it, during the lifetime of those who engaged in it either actively, or through counsel I am so fully
informed of what is needful to write this history, that I hope to supply my want of ability by the truth. Of this alone have
I deemed it fitting to advise the reader, and not of the advantage that will be derived from a perusal of this relation. For
if the reader desire my relation, any advice on my part will be superfluous; and otherwise, even though such advice guide
him rightly, it will be impossible to achieve anything thereby.

</p>
<p>[The first four books treat somewhat briefly of the legendary history and the European discovery of the the Malucos; their
importance in trade, by reason of their spices, and other resources; their inhabitants; the early Portuguese domination and
cruelties, and the consequent risings and rebellions of the natives; the civil wars between Ternate and Tidors; and the accession
of Felipe II to the Portuguese crown. The following extracts and abstracts are made from various parts of these four books:]

</p>
<p>The eastern archipelago ... embraces so many islands, that even yet we do not know their exact number. Modern writers make
five divisions of <a id="d0e3968"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3968">221</a>]</span>this archipelago, which are themselves a like number of archipelagos&#8212;namely, Maluco, Moro, Papuas, Celebes, and Amboyno. The
name of the first in that language is Moloc, and means the same as &#8220;capital,&#8221; for it is the capital of all the adjacent parts;
and, according to others, Maluco, which signifies in Arabic, as par excellence, &#8220;the kingdom.&#8221; It is reduced to five chief
islands, all under one meridian, all in sight of one another, and lying within a distance of twenty-five leguas. They lie
across the equator, their most northern latitude being one-half degree, and their most southern one degree. They are bounded
on the west by the island of Xil&ograve;lo, called Batochina de Moro by the Portuguese, and Alemaera by the Malucos. Of the many
islands round about, which are also called Malucas, ... the following are remarkable for the abundance of their spice, namely&#8212;beginning
at the north-Ternate, Tydore, Motiel, Maquien, and Bacham. In the time of their former pagans they were called Cape, Duco,
Moutil, Mara, and Seque ... The inhabitants differ from one another, as it were, by the miraculous kindness of nature. The
women are light-complexioned and beautiful, while the men have a complexion somewhat darker than a quince. The hair is smooth,
and many anoint it with fragrant oils.  They have large eyes and long eyelashes, which, with their eyebrows, they wear blackened.
Their bodies are robust, and they are much given to war, but to all other employment they are slothful. They live long, grow
gray early, and are always active, on sea no less than on land. Hospitable and kind to guests, they are importunate and insistent
in their demands when they become familiar. They are full <a id="d0e3970"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3970">222</a>]</span>of self-interest in their dealings, and make use of tricks, frauds, and lies. They are poor, and consequently proud; and,
to name many vices in one, they are ungrateful. The Chinese occupied all these islands when they subjugated all that orient,
then the Javanese and Malays, and lastly the Persians and Arabs. These last, by means of commerce, introduced the superstitions
of Mahomet among the worship of their gods (of whom some families boasted as ancestors). Their laws are barbarous. They set
no limit to their marriages. The chief wife of the king, called <i>putriz</i> in their language, determines nobility and the right to the succession&#8212;to which her children are preferred, even when they
are younger than the children of other mothers. Not even the slightest theft is pardoned, but adultery is easily excused.
At daybreak, those appointed for this duty sound (by law) large timbrels in the streets of the settlements, in order to awaken
married people, whom, on account of human propagation, they judge worthy of political care. The majority of crimes are punished
by death. In other things they obey the tyranny or will of the conqueror. The headdress of the men consists of colored Turkish
turbans, with many feathers in them. That of the king, which corresponds to a crown, has the form of a miter in its peak.
The remainder of the clothing universally consists of jackets which they call <i>cheninas</i>, and trousers of blue, crimson, green, or violet damask. Of the same material are their cloaks, which are short and military,
and fastened diagonally or knotted on the shoulder, after the fashion of the ancient Roman garments, as known to us by the
writings, statues, and other traces of those times. The women show off their hair, now <a id="d0e3978"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3978">223</a>]</span>letting it hang, and again knotting it upon the head, and placing various kinds of flowers in the bands that hold it; so that,
in the adjustment of their headdress, they are not embarrassed by veils, plumage, or feathers. All that variety, even without
art, adorns them. They wear bracelets, earrings, and necklaces of diamonds and rubies, and long strings of pearls&#8212;ornaments
that are not prohibited to the common people; as neither are silks, which are especially worn by the women after the fashion
of Persians and Turks. These are all the wealth of the seas and surrounding lands. Men and women betoken in their dress the
natural haughtiness of their disposition. The variety of their languages is not little. It may happen that one village cannot
understand the language of the next. Malay, being most easy to pronounce, is most common. From the variety of languages it
is inferred that these islands have been populated by different nations. Antiquity, and the art of navigating in those districts,
is ascribed to the Chinese. Others affirm that the Malucos are descended from the Javanese, who, attracted by the sweetness
of the odors wafted by the spices, stopped at Maluco. They took a cargo of cloves, which until then were unknown, and, continuing
to trade in these, carried them in their vessels to the Persian and Arabian straits. They went throughout those provinces,
carrying also ilks, and chinaware&#8212;products of the resources and skill of the Chinese. The cloves, by means of the Persians
and Arabs, came to the Greeks and Romans. Several Roman emperors tried to conquer the east, in order to find the spice regions,
so much did they desire the spice. Believing that they all came from China, they gave them Chinese names. <a id="d0e3980"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3980">224</a>]</span>The Spaniards formerly brought the spices with other merchandise from the Bermejo [<i>i.e.</i>, Red] or Erithrean Sea. The kings of Egypt once gained possession of the spices, and they reached Europe by way of the Asiatics.
When the Romans made Egypt one of their provinces, they continued the trade. The Genoese, much later, transferring the commerce
to Theodosia (now Cafa) distributed the spices, and there Venecia and other trading nations established their agents and factories.
They sailed later by way of the Caspian Sea and Trapisonda; but the trade fell with the empire, and the Turks carried this
merchandise in caravans of camels and dromedaries to Barcito, Lepo, and Damasco, and to various Mediterranean ports.<a id="d0e3985src" href="#d0e3985" class="noteref">3</a> The sultans of Cayro restored this trade to the Bermejo Sea, and to Alexandria by the Nilo [<i>i.e.</i>, Nile] River. The Portuguese deprived the sultans of it, after their conquest of the Eastern Indias, and now they bring the
spices by way of the cape of Buena Esperanza in their fleets; while with those that sail along the coasts of Arabia and Persia,
and to the cape of Guardafun, they prohibit drugs being taken to Cayro, sinking or capturing the vessel that tries to do so.
The sultan&#8217;s trade was suppressed by this fear and the security that was introduced, and all the spices come on the account
of the royal crown to India, with innumerable delays, until they reach Lisboa. He who is master of the navigation will be
master of this pleasing wealth.
<a id="d0e3991"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3991">225</a>]</span></p>
<p>[Mindanao&#8212;which, as appears from an allusion by Argensola, was not always considered a portion of the Philippines proper&#8212;is
visited by one of the early Portuguese conquerors, Captain Pinto, being sent there by Tristan de Atayde &#8220;and to the neighboring
islands, to provide themselves with the necessities of life.&#8221; There &#8220;he visited the king, by whom he was courteously received;
and after his credentials were examined, and consultation over his requests was held with the Sangages<a id="d0e3994src" href="#d0e3994" class="noteref">4</a> of the king&#8217;s council, peace and friendship were made. Pinto sold his merchandise at whatever price he wished, and traded
for and bought a cargo of provisions at will.&#8221; (Book ii, pp. 49&#8211;50.) The desire for cloves<a id="d0e4003src" href="#d0e4003" class="noteref">5</a> on the part of the Portuguese is so strong in the Malucos that the natives determine to burn their trees, although &#8220;the clove
harvest forms the wealth of the Maluco kings,&#8221; in order to cause them to leave. Although the threat is not carried out, wars
prevail constantly between natives and conquerors. The contests become so vindictive and troublesome that they lead to arguments
for abandoning the Philippines after Felipe II&#8217;s accession to the throne. The passages relating to this are as follows:]

</p>
<p>The apprehensions of this danger had made the ministers of all those provinces anxious, for their fears were being confirmed
by proofs of manifest rebellion. In Goa, Diego Lopez de Mezquita was already a prisoner in the fortress of Benastirim, and
under a strong guard, and the viceroy was awaiting <a id="d0e4008"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4008">226</a>]</span>the decision from Espa&ntilde;a to dispose of him and of the soldiers; for they feared lest the Ternatans would make use of the great
help that could be sent them by the Chinese; which could be sent much more easily if the matters then being discussed in Castilla
were made certain. It was reported that the Council of State&#8212;having noted that the Filipinas not only did not augment the
royal incomes, but were even lessening them, and were the occasion for fruitless expense; and that they were so numerous and
so difficult of conservation&#8212;had proposed to King Filipo, our sovereign, to abandon them, and withdraw the Audiencia and presidios
that sustained them. They added to this argument the example of the Chinese kings and nations, who also had abandoned those
islands&#8212;although they are so near and can aid them so easily, that the islands may be reckoned as a part of their mainland.
They said that as Espa&ntilde;a was governing them, signal detriment was being received, and there were no hopes that any betterment
would be obtained in future; for the amount of silver passing thither from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, both for regular expenses and for
merchandise, was immense. For the same reason, and by the same road, that treasure was being sent by the hands of the Chinese
to the center of those kingdoms, which, intractable by the severity of their laws, are debarred by those laws, as by arms
and fortifications, from all trade with foreigners. They asserted that the monarchy, scattered and divided by so many seas,
and climes, could scarcely be reduced to one whole; and that human foresight could not bind, by means of ability, provinces
separated by nature with so distant boundaries. These arguments, they said, were <a id="d0e4010"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4010">227</a>]</span>born not of the mind, but of experience, a truth manifest to the senses. All other arguments that could be adduced against
this reasoning they declared to be honorable and full of generous sound, but difficult of execution. It would be more advisable
to increase the power of the king in Europe, where the forces could attend to emergencies without the casualties that militate
against them in outside seas and dominions. Each one of these arguments was enforced so minutely by the ministers of the treasury
that this proposition merited consideration and examination. Had God permitted the king to exclude the Filipinas from his
monarchy, and leave them exposed to the power of whomsoever should seize them first, the Malucans would have so strengthened
the condition of their affairs that it would have been impregnable.

</p>
<p>This same resolution has been communicated on other occasions, and in the reign of King Filipo Third, now reigning. He, conforming
to his father&#8217;s reply, has ever refused to accept counsel so injurious. Consequently, that most prudent monarch answered that
the Filipinas would be conserved in their present condition, and that the Audiencia would be granted sufficient authority
so that justice could be more thoroughly administered; for in the completeness and rigor of justice the king based the duration
and energy of the state. For the same reason, the military force there would be strengthened, and the royal incomes of Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, or those of any other of his kingdoms, would be expended for that purpose, for all the treasures, and those still
to be discovered in the bosom of the mines, must be applied to the propagation of the gospel. For what, <a id="d0e4014"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4014">228</a>]</span>he asked, would the enemies of the gospel say, if they should see that the Filipinas were deprived of the light, and of the
ministers who preach it, because they did not produce metals and wealth as did other rich islands in Assia and America? He
said that the entire power of the sovereigns must minister to this superior end, as sons of the Church and assistants of the
apostolic voice, which is being continued in the successes of the first preaching. If he had refused to yield one jot in his
severity to his northern vassals,<a id="d0e4016src" href="#d0e4016" class="noteref">6</a> or to grant them liberty for their consciences, why should he relent toward the pagans and Mahometans, who are the harvest
that God has assigned him, in order to enrich the Church with those so remote children? By this wise he enjoined silence on
the discussion, and with this glorious aim the decision has ever been made when zeal or human convenience has discussed the
abandonment of those states.... This religious motive influenced Felipo; but, besides it, those who had experience of those
Asiatic sources of wealth urged others. The most abundant wealth consists of diamonds, rubies, large and seed pearls, amber,
musk, civet, and camphor, from Borneo and China; vermilion, coral, quicksilver, copper, and white cloth, from Cambaya and
Mengala; rugs, carpets, fine counterpanes, camlets, from Persia; brocades, ivory, rhubarb, cardamoms, cassia,<a id="d0e4019src" href="#d0e4019" class="noteref">7</a> incense, benzoin, wax, china, lac for medicine and dyes, cloves, and mace, from Banda; with gold, silver, and pearls, medicinal
<a id="d0e4033"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4033">229</a>]</span>woods, aroes, eagle-wood, calambuco,<a id="d0e4035src" href="#d0e4035" class="noteref">8</a> ebony, and innumerable other rare plants, drugs, spices, and ornaments. They say that Venecia lost all this when the commerce
passed to Portugal<a id="d0e4050src" href="#d0e4050" class="noteref">9</a> (Book ii, pp. 84&#8211;86)....

</p>
<p>[While the war between the Portuguese and the natives is at its height, a galleon passes which is later found to have been
neither Spanish nor Portuguese, as the natives fear, &#8220;but a ship of Venetians, private persons, on its way from Manila to
China, with various bartered merchandise of those states and of the east&#8221; (Book ii, p. 89).

</p>
<p>A native envoy visits Felipe II in Lisbon, but fails to accomplish much. The later wars between Portuguese and Spaniards and
natives are characterized by assistance for the latter from English and Dutch sources. King Felipe &#8220;especially to recover
T&eacute;mate,&#8221; turns &#8220;his eyes to the convenience afforded by all the Filipinas, to a greater extent than India.&#8221; Later he orders
by &#8220;his royal decree&#8221; that &#8220;all the governors of the Filipinas should be instructed to aid the Malucas, and all the Indian
states of the Portuguese crown; for this may be done more conveniently <a id="d0e4057"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4057">230</a>]</span>from those islands than from India itself&#8221; (Book iv, p. 140). Argensola recurring again to the proposition of abandoning the
Philippines and other islands, says:]

</p>
<p>The reader should also consider, that although avarice is sometimes mixed up in the ministry of the preaching of the gospel,
and lawless acts are committed by our captains and soldiers, yet such excesses do not make the cause less just. He should
consider also that, supposing that his Majesty should choose, for excellent state reasons (as we said were proposed), to abandon
those districts of Asia, as the Chinese did, and to narrow the bounds of his monarchy, the cause of the faith would not permit
it. Our kings are ministers of the faith, and sons of the Catholic church, and any war waged for the introduction of the gospel
is most important, and of the greatest profit, even though it be to acquire or to gain desert provinces. Besides the Filipinas
have shown how docile are their natives, and how thoroughly they benefit by the example and company of the Spaniards&#8212;the tokens
of the affection with which they have received the faith and aid the religious who are extending the faith and carrying it
to China, Japon, Camboxa, Mindanao, the Malucas, and the other places where endures idolatry or friendship with the demons
(which the former owners of the country left to them when they excluded those places from their dominion), or the fictions
of Mahomet, which those places afterward admitted. This is the chief reason for conserving those provinces. (Book iv, pp.
161, 162.)

<h3>Conquest of the Malucas Islands</h3>
<h3>Book Fifth</h3>
<p>After the Luzones or Manilas Islands&#8212;both these being ancient names&#8212;had been discovered by Magallanes, Sebastian Cano returned
to Espa&ntilde;a, after the former&#8217;s death and the successive deaths of his companions, in that venerable ship which&#8212;as if significant
of its voyage, which contains more of truth than of probability&#8212;they called &#8220;Vitoria.&#8221; Sebastian Cano was a mountaineer, from
the hamlet of Guetaria in the Pyrenees Mountains, according to Mapheo,<a id="d0e4069src" href="#d0e4069" class="noteref">10</a> in his Latin history. In his history he devotes much space to the great courage of Cano, and his skill in the arts of navigation.
He recounts the universal respect and admiration bestowed upon Cano, since he was the first in the age of mortals to circumnavigate
this globe. And in truth, what estimation can remain to the fabulous Argonauts, Tiphys and Jason, and the other navigators
whom the elegance or the daring of Grecia extols, when compared to our Cano? He was the first witness of the commerce of the
seas, and nature opened to his eyes what had been reserved until then for them; and he was <a id="d0e4075"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4075">232</a>]</span>allowed to explore it all, and to furnish a beginning in so arduous endeavors for the law that saves and renders eternal.
After the death of Magallanes, the Lusones Islands&#8212;which ought to have inherited his name, as being his sepulcher, as the
strait did because of his passage through it&#8212;changed that name for that of Filipinas,<a id="d0e4077src" href="#d0e4077" class="noteref">11</a> in the year one thousand five hundred and sixty-five; although those islands of that eastern archipeago are also called by
that name. Adelantado Miguel de Legaspe, who was sent from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a by Viceroy Don Luys de Velasco with a Spanish fleet,
made port in those islands. He conquered first the island of Zebu and those in its vicinity, where he remained six years.
That region is called by another name, Pintados, still preserved by different portions of that coast, because the Indians
at that time went about naked, and with their bodies adorned and painted [<i>i.e.</i>, tattooed] in various colors. Legaspe left a guard there and went to occupy Luzon, one hundred and fifty leguas from Zeb&ucirc;.
He fought the barbarians, whom, after the surprise of our ships, weapons, and faces had worn off, the same novelty encouraged.
Legaspe anchored in a bay four leguas wide, which shows an island midway in its entrance, now called Mar&iacute;velez. The bay has
a circuit of thirty leguas to the city of Manila, and is eight leguas wide from north to east. The inhabitants of that city
resisted him with greater courage than the Pintados, for they had artillery and a fort. But after the Spaniards had taken
that, the defenders of it surrendered. This was done quickly, and allowed no time for the inhabitants to unite. Thus did Legaspe
<a id="d0e4083"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4083">233</a>]</span>enter Manila, a place fortified by nature. At one point of it (which is surrounded by the water of the bay) is a river of
considerable volume, whose source is the great Lake of Vay [Bay], five leguas distant. This point, narrow and slender at first,
becomes wider immediately, for the seashore turns toward the southwest, and the bank of the river toward the east, so that
a very considerable space is left for the city. The city is entirely surrounded with water, except that part between the west
and south. Legaspe founded the city then with wooden buildings, for wood is produced abundantly in those regions. The roofs
of the houses were covered with nipa leaves, which resemble our mace-reed,<a id="d0e4085src" href="#d0e4085" class="noteref">12</a> and which form a sufficient defense against the rains. It is, however, an inflammable material, and is the occasion of the
great fires that have happened there so often. Luzon is more densely populated than any of the many islands&#8212;which are called
Filipinas in honor of King Filipo II, and which, as is affirmed, number eleven thousand. Luzon has a circumference of three
hundred and fifty leguas. Beyond the bay it runs one hundred leguas to the north, as far as Nueva Segovia; from the beginning
of that province (namely, Cape Bojador), it runs for thirty leguas east to the promontory of El Enga&ntilde;o. Thence the coast runs
south for eighty leguas, and then with another changed direction for forty leguas to what they call Embocadero [&#8220;the channel&#8221;],
that is, the strait opposite the island Tandaya, which is distant eighty more leguas from the bay. Consequently the island
has the shape of a square; it has many harbors, but <a id="d0e4091"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4091">234</a>]</span>few capacious ports. Manila is in slightly more than fourteen degrees of northern latitude, and in longitude (reckoning from
the Canarias) one hundred and sixty. The most northern part of Luzon lies in nineteen degrees [of latitude]. With the sea
between them, the great kingdom of China lies on that side of it, seventy leguas away; while the islands of Japon lie to the
northeast, at a distance of two hundred and fifty leguas. On the east is the open ocean, and on the south the greatest of
the archipelagos of the ocean, which is divided into live archipelagos. These are broken up into so many islands, kingdoms,
and provinces, that one would believe that nature did not desire men to ascertain their number. Both Javas, our Malucas, Borneo,
and Nueva Guinea are known; on the west, and at a distance of three hundred leguas, Malaca, Sian, Patan, Camboxa, Cochinchina,
and other different provinces on the mainland of Asia. The Chinese abandoned living in our Filipinas, but not its trade; nor
did the cultivation or the fertility of the islands for that Reason cease. Wheat and other necessary grains are produced there
in abundance: deer, Cattle, buffaloes, goats, and wild boars; and fruits and spices. If there be anything lacking, the Chinese
from Chincheo bring it, such as chinaware and silks. The wine always used and drunk there is made from palms, by cutting off
the clusters of fruit that they produce, when green&#8212;that fruit is called cocos&#8212;from which, after cutting the leaf stalks,
they gather the liquor that flows forth, and boil it in jars, until it becomes so strong that it causes intoxication and has
the same effects as the strongest Spanish wine. Of native fruits, there are oranges, lemons, and very sweet citrons; while
they have fig and pear-trees <a id="d0e4093"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4093">235</a>]</span>introduced from Espa&ntilde;a. They rear sparrow-hawks, herons [<i>martinetes</i>], and royal eagles in great abundance. They have a great many different kinds of parrots, and other birds, large and small.
In the rivers and lakes are many horrible caymans or crocodiles; these kill the Indians very easily&#8212;and especially the children,
who go carelessly to their haunts&#8212;as well as the cattle when they go to drink. Not a few times has it happened that they have
seized the cattle by the muzzles and pulled them beneath the water, and drowned them without power to resist, however large
the animal may be. Then the carcass is dragged ashore and devoured ... Indians are found so courageous that, notwithstanding
the fierceness of those animals, they kill them with their hands. They cover the left hand and arm with a glove made from
buffalo hide, and hold therein a stake or peg, somewhat longer than a tercia,<a id="d0e4098src" href="#d0e4098" class="noteref">13</a> and about as thick as the wrist, and sharpened at both ends. Then they enter the river until the water reaches the waist.
The crocodile rushes upon the Indian with open mouth to devour him. The latter presents to it his protected arm and the hand
with the stake, so that the beast may seize it, and runs it into the animal&#8217;s mouth in such a position that it cannot shut
its mouth or make use of its strong teeth to attack its slayer. Feeling the pain of the sharp stake the crocodile becomes
so docile that it neither resists nor attacks, nor dares move, for the slightest movement causes it pain. Thereupon the barbarian,
pulling strongly on the stake, wounds the beast repeatedly with a dagger (carried in the right hand) in the throat, until
it bleeds to death. Then it is drawn <a id="d0e4101"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4101">236</a>]</span>ashore with lines and ropes, with the aid of other Indians who unite to drag it in; and many are needed, because of the huge
bodies of those crocodiles. They resemble lizards, but are furnished with scales so strong that scarce can an arquebus-shot
dent them. The only vulnerable spots are the throat and under parts of the legs [<i>i.e.</i>, where they join the body], where nature has given them a certain sweet odor, which the Indians use. Besides cattle, all
the animals of Africa and more are found in those islands&#8212;tigers, lions, bears, foxes, monkeys, apes, squirrels&#8212;and in some
of them are many civet-cats. These last are wont to be hunted extensively, in order to take them to different nations with
the other merchandise of China&#8212;linens, silks, earthenware, iron, copper, steel, quicksilver, and innumerable other things,
which are transported annually from those provinces. Religion and government are the same as those of Espa&ntilde;a; but in those
islands that are still unsubdued, foolish idolatry prevails. They attribute immortality to their souls, but they believe that
souls wander from one body to another, according to that ridiculous [doctrine of] transmigration invented or declared by Pythagoras.
Trading is much in vogue, and is advanced by the Chinese commerce. The Filipinos are more courageous than their other neighbors.
The Spaniards and creoles do not belie their high origin.

</p>
<p>By order of King Filipo an army was formed from all this people, in order to attempt to take the forts of Maluco. Don Gon&ccedil;alo
Ronquillo de Pe&ntilde;alosa was governor. Although he had received beforehand certain information by way of trade and the spies
that had gone there, he was not satisfied with <a id="d0e4108"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4108">237</a>]</span>them, and sent another soldier to Maluco. The latter changed his clothes, and then with that and his aspect, which was not
unlike that of the natives, and their language, which he spoke fluently, went to Tydore. He found our men very desirous of
the enterprise, and the king of that island ready to push it with his forces. He went to Ternate with the merchants, and saw
the fortresses and the reefs about the ports; and sounded their friendship with the English. He found that the latter landed
and traded securely&#8212;or rather, as if by right. Nor was the multitude of secret Christians unknown to him, who would take up
arms in due season; nor any of the other things, that, as an experienced spy, it was necessary for him to report. Thereupon
Ronquillo prepared about three hundred Spaniards and more than one thousand five hundred Filipinos, with ammunition, food,
and sailors. With three large vessels and a considerable number of smaller ones, he set sail toward Maluco at the proper season.
Pedro Sarmiento was general, an energetic and experienced man, who still lives in Manila. He set out courageously and energetically,
in order to destroy any of the enemies then sailing those seas. Several days previous his Majesty had appointed Pablo de Lima
to the charge of Ternate, if it were gained; and had allowed his brother, Francisco de Lima, the concession of two voyages
to Maluco, in consideration of their services and those of Henrique, their father. Pablo had married a Christian woman, and
a devout one, although she was a relative of the king of Tydore, who is not a Christian. For this reason, and because he possessed
in Ternate the ancient inheritance to the towns of Guita, Mofaquia, Mofaguita, Pauate, Pelueri, Sansuma, <a id="d0e4110"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4110">238</a>]</span>Tahane, Mayloa, and Soma; and in the island of Maquien, Sabele, Talapao, Talatoa, Mofabouaua, Tabalola, Tagono, Bobaba, and
Molapa&#8212;of the majority of which the Ternatan king had dispossessed him, as well as Bitua and other towns in Tydore, on the
pretext of his having abandoned them&#8212;he went to Manila, where he discussed with the governor the method of facilitating the
conquest, on the very eve of its execution. His counsel was favored, and he gave it as it was his own cause. For, in addition
to the inheritance that the king of Ternate had usurped from him, he expected to get the island of Moutil, which had belonged
to his ancestors. The expedition was also authorized by the presence of Don Juan Ronquillo, the governor&#8217;s nephew, who held
equal authority by land and sea with Sarmiento. If there were anything wanting, it was thought that it would be supplied easily
by the valor of the soldiers, together with the shortness of the voyage and the carelessness of the enemy. But the divided
command proved an obstacle to that hope. Their voyage was not stormy, but neither was it so favorable that they were enabled
to anchor exactly at Ternate, as was necessary in order to deprive the enemy from using their own vigilance. They went to
Moutil to anchor, and within sight of the inhabitants of the land, fought with some hostile <i>janquas</i>.<a id="d0e4115src" href="#d0e4115" class="noteref">14</a> These were captured, and the Christians found within them were set at liberty. As Pablo de Lima knew the harbors, and as
the people of the island did not possess the forces necessary to defend themselves against a fleet, and as it was easily attacked
on the sides, it surrendered. The natives came with branches of palms, citron-trees, <a id="d0e4118"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4118">239</a>]</span>and gariofylos [<i>i.e., caryophyllus</i>], or clove-trees, as tokens of peace, and to beg pardon. They obtained both, and for master, Pablo de Lima. However the vesting
him with that domain proved cf little utility; for a few days after, all the people slipped away, either considering themselves
more secure in Ternate, or to meet the enemy&#8212;who must necessarily carry the war to that island, as happened. Sarmiento repaired
his vessels on that island [<i>i.e.</i>, Moutil], and without the loss of a single soldier, and flushed by his first victory, went to Talangame, passing through
the hostile caracoas, which had been fitted up hastily and without order. The fort and the king, in possession of our artillery&#8212;especially
the rampart, which was enlarged and afterward called Cachil Tulo, after the king&#8217;s uncle, who built it&#8212;were in readiness long
before, and were threatening some great disaster. Our men landed on that side, but their landing was opposed by the Ternatans.
However night put an end to battle, and each side retiring to safety, our men finished landing and mounting their artillery,
in the position and manner counseled by Pablo de Lima, who ever since then has been general of artillery in the fort of Tydore.
The king of that island wished to join our troops, as was shown by certain actions, and by his promises to Alf&eacute;rez Due&ntilde;as;
but he doubted the fortune of the Castilians, as if he had not had many experiences of it. Now the occasion persuaded him
and fidelity bound him, but he still hesitated. The doubt of that king is believed to have hurt the outcome of the affair.
Sarmiento, after having mounted the artillery and securely fortified himself, and after having taken some captives (from whom
he learned the food supply and arms of the <a id="d0e4126"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4126">240</a>]</span>besieged), commenced to hem in the enemy, and to bombard them furiously. However he did not scare them, for they answered
boldly. It became necessary to seize the high places, from which, as from commanding eminences&#8212;which were leveled later&#8212;our
men harassed the enemy. Had they persevered in this, it would have sufficed to end the war. But to such an extent did sickness
reign in our camp, that no better medicine was found than that of absence, and deferring this undertaking to another time.
The assistance from Tydore was of no consequence. They proved lukewarm friends, and all the rest was spiritless. Heaven knows
the other reasons. There must have been some stronger ones; for, in reality, the camp was raised, and after embarking returned
to Manila, without having had any greater effect than to increase the confidence of the enemy.

</p>
<p>Then only the English nation disturbed Spanish dominion in that orient. Consequently King Filipo desired not only to forbid
it with arms near at hand, but also to furnish an example, by their punishment, to all the northern nations, so that they
should not undertake the invasions that we see. A beginning was made in this work in the year one thousand five hundred and
eighty-eight, as is related in the following discourse.

</p>
<p>[The beheading of Mary Stuart, the English confederation with Holland, and the building, disaster, and defeat of the &#8220;invincible
armada&#8221; follow. The narrative continues:]

</p>
<p>The Hollanders or Zealanders, confederated with Queen Isabel [<i>i.e.</i>, Elizabeth of England], being witnesses of that event [<i>i.e.</i>, the defeat of the armada], were encouraged to aspire to greater efforts, <a id="d0e4140"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4140">241</a>]</span>in disobedience to their religion and to their sovereign, to usurp the eastern riches&#8212;mines, spices, drugs, and silks&#8212;as is
seen by their reckless voyages, in which they have been emulous of the recent examples set by the English, and by the more
ancient ones left us by Colon, Alburquerque, Magallanes, Gama, and Cortes, as we shall see later....

</p>
<p>After Santiago de Vera became governor of the Filipinas, he was especially ordered to equip a fleet to attack Ternate, where
the English, from that time forward, were trading with all security. All nations had established factories there, except the
Javanese and the Lascars. More than two thousand five hundred Moros from Meca were preaching their abominable doctrine. They
did not fear Portugal; all their fear was caused by the Castilians, whom but lately they found pledged to vengeance. The king
of Ternate knew that Sarmiento and Ronquillo would have taken it, had not disease prevented them. When the new preparation
was learned in Tydore, the rumor was taken to Ternate by spies. That king immediately summoned his vassals, especially the
islanders of Maquien and Homero, who, inasmuch as those islands are so densely populated, responded with forty caracoas. The
number would have been greater, but the king would not permit that more should be equipped than he requested, as he could
not conceal his dread lest they rebel, as the lands were full of Christians, and the tributes that he had imposed on them
were so excessive. Santiago de Vera made Captain Juan Morones general, who was not lacking in prudence, just as valor was
not lacking to the soldiers, or ammunition and artillery to the fleet. Pablo de Lima assisted in both forces. But <a id="d0e4144"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4144">242</a>]</span>whether caused by natural ambition, or want of harmony in some other way, they were so disunited that one would have prophesied
jealousies before they left Manila. They set sail in good weather, and escaped the greatest hardships of the sea. But when
they considered themselves safe, all the elements were loosed upon the fleet. Light and reckoning failed them. The boats were
shattered and the most important one sunk, with the loss of all its crew. That was the galleon called &#8220;Santa Helena,&#8221; which
was carrying the pieces to bombard the fortress, and considerable of the other ammunition and apparatus. However they persisted,
and the king of Bacham assisted them with the men that he had raised under the pretext of sweeping the sea of certain enemies;
and, as a baptized Christian, he bewailed the apostasy that he had made, because of persecution, from the glorious confession
of our faith, and promised the restitution of his soul.

</p>
<p>[The futile operations of the Spaniards at Ternate follow. Refusing advice, the commander tries to take the main fort instead
of attacking in different places with small detachments. Finally the siege is raised, when the enemy is almost starved out.
Communication with traders from Europe is again free to Ternate, &#8220;especially with their new friends, the English.&#8221; But internal
disputes and ambitions in Ternate lead to the following letter to Santiago de Vera from Cachil Tulo, uncle of the illegitimate
king of Ternate:]

</p>
<p>My brother, Cachil Babu, former king of Ternate, wrote to Portugal to the king, requesting justice on a man who killed his
father and mine, in return for which he promised to deliver to his Majesty the fort <a id="d0e4150"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4150">243</a>]</span>of Ternate, of which he had been dispossessed. And as his Majesty succeeded to the kingdoms of Portugal, he answered my brother&#8217;s
letter by Cachil Naique, his ambassador. But when it arrived, my brother was already dead, for which reason we did not then
deliver the fortress, as a bastard son had succeeded him, whom the Ternatans, with the help of the king of Tydore, elevated
as king, although he had no right to the throne. He refused to fulfil his father&#8217;s promise and pledge. Neither would he take
my counsel or that of my brother, Cachil Mandraxa, rightful heir of the kingdom, namely, that he deliver the fortress, as
his father had promised the Portuguese&#8212;not because he could not defend himself from them or from his Majesty, but expressly
because he had been thus ordered by his father and my brother. It must not be understood that it was taken from us by force
of arms, but that we of ourselves had this will to deliver the fortress to serve his Majesty. Upon seeing us with this intention
he determined to kill my brother, his uncle, the rightful heir of the kingdom, by having him stabbed by the hand of a slave,
under his word and security and mine. Therefore, considering such action of my nephew senseless, and that he refuses to fulfil
what his father and I and my brothers promised to his Majesty, I have determined, now and henceforth, to become the true vassal
and servant of his Majesty. By this present I bind myself, and I swear by my religion, as I did so swear, and I shall not
annul my pledge, through the father-vicar Antonio Ferreyra, to give all my help and aid for the taking of the fort, with all
my kindred and friends, until his Majesty&#8217;s captain takes possession of it or he <a id="d0e4152"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4152">244</a>]</span>who shall hereafter come with the Portuguese and Castilians, who shall be in his company. [This I shall do] provided that
the captain or captains in his Majesty&#8217;s name shall fulfil toward me the signed promise of Duarte Pereyra, the chief captain,
inasmuch as I gave him another such message. That is to proclaim me king of Ternate, as soon as he shall take possession of
the fort for his Majesty; for it belongs to me both through my father, and by the service that I am rendering, and that I
hope to render later, to his Majesty. Therefore, I beseech your Lordship for favor, and request you in his Majesty&#8217;s name
to aid me by sending the greatest possible number of soldiers; and that quickly, so that this my intention and will to serve
his Majesty in this may be achieved, and, as I hope, without loss of life&#8212;although, as your Lordship will have learned, this
fortress is well garrisoned. The order and arrangement that these soldiers would better observe will be written to your Lordship
by the chief captain. Given in Tydore, where I have come for this purpose, as the father-vicar Antonio Ferreyra and the auditor
Antonio de Matos will testify, whom, as such persons, I begged to sign for me. May 23.

</p>
<p>[The letter of the Portuguese commander verifies the above letter, and asks for four hundred Spanish soldiers, under pretext
of sending them &#8220;to drive the Javanese from those seas, whose friendship the Ternatans value more than ours.&#8221; They at least
will keep the English from Ternatan ports. Fifteen fragatas and one galleon will be enough, and they are to be accompanied
by Filipino pioneers. He tries to persuade the governor to undertake the expedition. Vera is anxious to do so, but is unable
to attempt it <a id="d0e4156"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4156">245</a>]</span>at once. Meanwhile Cachil Tulo dies, and the vigilance required in watching the Chinese and Japanese in the Philippines renders
it impossible to send the expedition to Ternate. &#8220;Each one of these expeditions made inroads on the treasury and forces of
the province, to so great an extent that it was necessary to allow a breathing-space to each of them.&#8221; It is thought that
a joint expedition from Malaca and Manila will accomplish more, and this is made some years later, under Andres Furtado de
Mendoza, of whose character and some of whose deeds there follows an account. The island of Ceylon, its products and fauna
are partially described, and some of its connection with the Portugese. Returning to Philippine matters, the narrative continues:]

</p>
<p>At this time Santiago de Vera was already dismissed from his governorship of the Filipinas. After he had communicated with
Andres Furtado, and received an answer from him, in which the latter coincided with his desire, fortune disturbed these beginnings,
and Furtado became embroiled with those who did not love him, and Santiago de Vera was withdrawn from his office. Gomez Perez
de las Mari&ntilde;as, knight of the habit of Santiago, succeeded him. He was a man of great reputation, a native of Betan&ccedil;os in
the kingdom of Galicia. He reached Filipinas in the year one thousand five hundred and ninety. He brought his son Don Luis
with him, a knight of the habit of Alc&aacute;ntara. The new governor found Manila open to attack, without the form of a city, and
without any money with which to improve it. More than two hundred thousand pesos were needed for it. However, by his plans
and schemes, he completed the work without public <a id="d0e4160"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4160">246</a>]</span>or private loss. He established a monopoly of playing cards, imposed fines for excessive play, punished illicit combinations
and frauds among the provision-dealers and the shops of that class: from all of which resulted the walls of Manila, which
measured twelve thousand eight hundred and forty-nine geometric feet [<i>i.e.</i>, Spanish feet], each foot being one tercia. To this he added his own careful oversight, and the assistance of the inhabitants,
who aided willingly because of the request and example of their chief. The city had but one fort, and that badly constructed.
He built another at the entrance to the river, to which he gave the name of Santiago, and enclosed the old one. He finished
the cathedral, and, from the foundation, the church of Santa Potenciana, patroness of the island, as a shelter for women.
Then he started the casting of cannon, and brought good artisans, who furnished the city with large and small artillery. He
built galleys for the trade and commerce or merchandise&#8212;the subsistence of those lands. And in fulfilment of his promises
in Espa&ntilde;a, he cast his eyes on Ternate and all of Maluco, on the late disgrace and the unfortunate results of his predecessors
who had attempted the conquest of that choice kingdom, and the punishments of its tyrants. He communicated these thoughts
orally and by letters with zealous persons, more particularly with Marta,<a id="d0e4165src" href="#d0e4165" class="noteref">15</a> a priest of the Society of Jesus, a serious and <a id="d0e4171"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4171">247</a>]</span>energetic man, whose experience and instruction had been of great use in those regions. This man gave him information, counsels,
and helpers for the preparation and for the work. One of the latter was Brother Gaspar Gomez, a Spaniard, a lay religious
of the same society. Among the many conferences that were held upon this matter, I find an exhortation from Father Antonio
Marta, in a letter written from Tydore. As it is the original, and good for the better understanding, I will place it here,
translated from the Portuguese....

</p>
<p>[The letter above mentioned holds out to Dasmari&ntilde;as the three inducements of service to the king, service to God, and personal
ambition, in the proposed Molucca expedition. The war will be an arduous one, for &#8220;it will be fought not with the Ternatans
alone, but with all the Moros of this archipelago,&#8221; and the natives are brave and determined. &#8220;The people of Tydore already
say that they do not want Spaniards in these regions,&#8221; and Gomez Perez will find it prudent to dissemble with them, &#8220;so that
they will not join the Ternatans.&#8221; Father Marta sends a map of the archipelago, promises immense booty, and assures the governor
of the prayers of the religious. This letter, and conferences with one Geronymo de Azevedo and Brother Gaspar Gomez, decided
the governor to undertake the expedition. He sent Gaspar Gomez with instructions to visit and inspect various parts of the
archipelago; and the latter visited Ternate, Tydore, Mindanao, both Javas, and other regions as far as Malaca. The rest of
book five is taken up with a relation of Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a&#8217;s services and his appointment to Cartagena in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a.]
<a id="d0e4175"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4175">248</a>]</span></p>
<p class="div2"><a id="d0e4176"></a></p>
<h3>Conquest of the Malucas Islands</h3>
<h3>Book Sixth</h3>
<p>Meanwhile Gomez Perez, attentive to his preparation, concealed his purpose, while not sparing the expenses pertaining to ships,
food, and men. Among other supplies, he built four fine galleys. To man them&#8212;as is there reported&#8212;he employed a means that
was considered severe. He ordered that the number of Indians sufficient to equip the galleys<a id="d0e4183src" href="#d0e4183" class="noteref">16</a> be purchased from those who were the slaves of other Indian chiefs, and that the Spanish encomenderos should pay for these
men from their own money. The price assigned for each Indian was two taes of gold&#8212;each tae being slightly more than one onza&#8212;the
value formerly general among them for slaves. He promised that the sum spent by the encomenderos for that purpose would be
repaid afterward from the royal exchequer. However, this did not seem any lessening of the severity, for he improperly called
those Indians slaves; but [among themselves] their masters treat them and love them as children, feed them at their tables,
and marry them to their daughters. Besides, slaves were then valued higher. To the anger of those who were about to be sold,
was joined that of the encomenderos, who were obliged to contribute from their property for expenses&#8212;which, in their opinion,
were not very necessary&#8212;and to offend their tributaries by forcibly seizing them; while they themselves would never collect
the price they were paying in advance, which was [to them] the most certain thing. The governor gave <a id="d0e4192"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4192">249</a>]</span>out that those galleys were to assure the country and defend it from the danger that threatened; for he knew absolutely that
the emperor of Japon was going to attack it with a huge war-fleet. Without galleys it could not be defended, and consequently
he was forced to man them with those slaves, since other rowers were lacking. These slaves were not to be chained in the galley,
or treated as convicts; but would receive so great kindness that they themselves would prefer that treatment to that of their
owners, whom they already had as fathers and fathers-in-law. These arguments, and the pressing need for defense, silenced
all objections. But they did not silence report, for already it was known that he had come from Espa&ntilde;a, pledged to the king,
his ministers, relatives, and backers, to the Ternate undertaking; and, although he concealed it, unknown authors divulged
it. Yet some tried to persuade him not to entrust the defense of Filipinas to the Chinese or Sangleys, for no bond, natural
or civil, had ever bound or attracted them to any love for the islands. They bade him remember the recent example of what
those people did on an occasion on which they were employed by his predecessor, and to be on his guard against them. He [<i>i.e.</i>, Vera], sending a re&euml;nforcement of men, ammunition, and food to the fort and settlement of Cagay&agrave;n&#8212;which is on the shore
of that island of Luzon, eighty leguas from the city of Manila&#8212;inasmuch as he then had no ship in which to send them, and
being constrained by his present necessity, thought that he could supply the deficiency by using for that purpose a ship of
the Chinese, then anchored at that port and about to return to China. He ordered the re&euml;nforcement to be embarked on that
boat and <a id="d0e4197"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4197">250</a>]</span>the Chinese to convey it; and to leave it, on passing, at its destination, since that was directly on their way. He promised
the Chinese to recompense and reward them for that service. They offered to do it with great display of willingness, howbeit
that their cunning was seen in the sequel, and what opportunity teaches to him that awaits it. The Chinese set sail, and on
the second day, while our Spaniards were asleep, and quite sure of being among friends and faithful ones, the Chinese attacked
them in the night, so suddenly that they could not defend themselves. They were all beheaded and thrown into the sea. The
Chinese pillaged all their cargo, and after dividing the booty, sailed for their own country. They only kept with them one
wretched Spanish woman who accompanied our men. They left her alive, but after having insulted and maltreated her, left her
on the first Chinese shore that they reached. She went then to the magistrates there, and informed them of the treachery committed
by those people, and of the violence that they had inflicted on her. But although the judges were courteous to her, no satisfaction
was given her for her injuries, and she was unable to obtain justice. On the contrary they ordered her to be taken into the
interior by certain agents, and delivered to other supreme judges. On that journey, which was very long and many leguas, she
endured greater hardships&#8212;until some governors, taking compassion on her and her tears, took her to the city of Macao, where
the Portuguese reside, and they set her at liberty. Through that means, the whole deed was learned, and was in the mouth of
all in Manila; and upon the occasion of this expedition, they exaggerated it still more.
<a id="d0e4199"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4199">251</a>]</span></p>
<p>Finally, all of the slaves demanded by Governor Gomez Perez had to be supplied, but with injuries and acts of oppression;
and with the same injuries and oppression they were all put on the galleys. There they remained some time before sailing,
and some of them died, because they were unused to that life. All those slaves proved insufficient to man all the galleys,
and the flagship was without rowers. On that account, and in order to complete the work, more severe methods were used than
at first. The governor ordered that two hundred and fifty Chinese be drafted from those who go to Filipinas to trade, in order
to man or equip the flagship. Each of them was to be paid two pesos monthly from the royal treasury. The governor assured
them that they would not be chained, but free, and could have their weapons and serve as soldiers, and would only have to
row the galley during calms, if any should occur, and in order to double certain headlands. This decision being communicated
to the Chinese, they ail refused it as an intolerable burden. But when our governor insisted upon this, in order to carry
out his design, the Chinese governor assembled his people in order to discuss the matter, and to plan how they might choose
two hundred and fifty from among them all; and he threatened that he would take every tenth man by their houses. That threat
disturbed them so much, that the next day, all their windows were closed, and the merchants closed their shops; and the community
was deprived of the provisions which were supplied to it by them. Our governor, upon seeing this, saying that they had mutinied,
had about fifty of them seized, the first whom he could find, and put them in the galleys at the oar. Thereupon <a id="d0e4202"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4202">252</a>]</span>the rest, being cowed, assembled, and made up from among their number all the two hundred and fifty. And inasmuch as no one
of them wished to be of that number, they distributed among those who accepted that service twenty thousand pesos, which were
given as a present to those Chinese who would go on the galley, each one being given eighty pesos, besides the king&#8217;s pay.
With this good aid, Chinese were not wanting to consent to act as rowers, although the twenty thousand pesos were spent among
them&#8212;or, more correctly, among the officers. From those two hundred and fifty Chinese, five companies were formed, and five
Chinese Christians appointed as captains. They made their musters and reviews, with pikes and catans&#8212;which are but slightly
different from cutlasses&#8212;and appeared to be happy and contented. Amid these occupations Brother Gaspar Gomez came unexpectedly
to Manila, loaded with information which he referred to the governor in a number of private conferences. He said that the
king of Ternate was not badly prepared, although his forces were somewhat weakened by his not being in very great harmony
with the majority of the chiefs of his kingdom. Many were threatening to rebel because of his tyrannies and excessive levies
of tribute. Now Javanese, Lascars, and Moros from Meca no longer resorted to Ternate, as they did in the time when Captain
Morones went there during the term of Santiago de Vera. Gaspar Gomez gave very detailed information about the two forts of
Talangame. He found that the king of Ternate usually had about three thousand soldiers, one thousand of them arquebusiers;
while a considerable number came from the other kingdoms of his <a id="d0e4204"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4204">253</a>]</span>crown. They fought with missile weapons, campilans, and shields, and other armor of coats-of-mail and helmets, which Portuguese
had traded for spice. They had considerable ammunition, all made by themselves from materials taken there by the Javanese
as payment for cloves. Their chief place was the city of Ternate, where the king and all his court resided. Consequently it
was the best guarded, and from that place the others obtained strength, courage, and all re&euml;nforcement. Gaspar Gomez advised
that our army attack before dawn, for all assaults made at dawn on that people had always succeeded well. If our fleet could
arrive unseen, it would without doubt conquer. But that king had placed spies and sentinels on almost all of his islands,
and even in Canela, Sarrang&aacute;n, and Mindanao. From the fort of Amboyno and from the kings of Syan [<i>i.e.</i>, Sia&oacute;] and Tidore, a goodly number of bronze culverins and much other artillery could be brought in their caracoas. The Amboynos
would send these at command, and they would be sent from Syan and Tydore as soon as requested; for, besides doing homage to
the crown of Espa&ntilde;a, those kings are hostile to Ternate. The supplies necessary to finish the war, even in case the king of
Tydore should fail them (of whom it might be suspected that he did not wish to see his enemy totally destroyed), were the
artillery and craft that were being prepared; and more than one thousand two hundred soldiers, well-armed and equipped with
coats-of-mail and helmets, until they should go to the island of Banda in order to garrison that island as it needed. There
should be a number of light vessels to catch the enemy when fleeing. Thus would the war be finished entirely and quickly,
and without <a id="d0e4209"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4209">254</a>]</span>bloodshed. The infidel Ternatans themselves even said and published the same. They confessed that, if a large contingent of
soldiers should reach their land, they would universally render homage without fighting. Consequently he inferred that secret
Christians were living in the Malucas. The entire conquest of that island of Banda was very useful and advantageous, and of
slight risk; and its maintenance was of great importance to the inhabitants of Amboyno, which belongs to us. Gaspar Gomez
also affirmed that the Portuguese were facilitating the enterprise considerably, and recounted the interest and profit that
would accrue to his Majesty. Father Antonio Marta was also of that opinion, in whom Governor Gomez Perez placed so great faith.
Brother Gaspar Gomez to these so full reports and information added such details that he quite set on fire the mind of the
governor.

</p>
<p>At this time the king of Camboxa, named Landara, sent the governor an embassy through two Spanish captains, accompanied by
many Cambodians, with the requisite authority for prosecuting his cause. That barbarous king took care that his ambassadors
should not be natives of his kingdoms, because of the lack of confidence with which his vassals inspired him as to their faithfulness.
He chose the ambassadors from different classes, so that a good result might come from the difference of their characters
and dispositions. One was a Portuguese, Diego Veloso by name, and the other a Castilian, Blas Ruyz de Fernan Gon&ccedil;alez.<a id="d0e4213src" href="#d0e4213" class="noteref">17</a>  They presented <a id="d0e4221"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4221">255</a>]</span>Gomez Perez with a fine gift, consisting of a considerable quantity of ivory, benzoin, chinaware, pieces of silks and cottons,
and an elephant of a noble disposition, as was learned later by experience. They proposed their embassy, which was, in short,
to beg help against the king of Syan [<i>i.e.</i>, Siam], who was about to attack the Cambodian king with a vast army. The latter in recognition of that aid offered to become
a vassal of the king of Espa&ntilde;a, and a Christian. That king was certain that so valorous and courageous a knight as Gomez Perez
would, under no circumstance, refuse a deed in which God would receive so obvious a service, and that would be so advantageous
to the crown of Espa&ntilde;a. The governor accepted the present, and responded to it by another of certain European products, and
thanked the king for his confidence in applying to him. However, it was impossible for him to set about that help just then,
or divert any portion of those forces that were prepared to punish the king of Ternate and recover that kingdom and the rest
of Maluco, which had rebelled with so great an insult and outrage to the Spanish nation. His Highness should trust in God
our Lord, and persevere in his attempt to serve him in the holy and true religion. When the Ternate enterprise was over, he
would take his force to the relief of Camboxa. With these hopes, which were fulfilled by Don Luys de las Mari&ntilde;as, his son,
those ambassadors left. In order to give them truthful satisfaction and a just cause for the delay, it was necessary to publish
the true purpose of that fleet, which until then had been kept secret.
<a id="d0e4226"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4226">256</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then the governor determined upon his departure, and tried to take with him as many men as possible. They were enlisted, willingly
or by force&#8212;those who were requested and those who were compelled, alike. The encomenderos and soldiers caused a prodigal
expense in ships, supplies and parades&#8212;which, because of the great opportunity furnished for all that in Filipinas, exceeded
the governor&#8217;s power and wishes. The governor sent Don Luys, his son, with all the regulars to the island of Cebu, where all
the fleet was to be assembled. There he remained six months, awaiting new orders. Gomez Perez was detained in Manila, planning
matters of importance. Two days before leaving, while a guest and dining at the house of Pedro de Roxas, his assistant, where
he was wont to amuse himself in heavy gaming and merriment, he became so gay&#8212;beyond his custom, and contrary to the harshness
of his character&#8212;that many interpreted it as his last farewell, and an omen of what happened. He recounted in conversation,
amid much laughter, that father Fray Vicente, of the Franciscan order, had told him that that enterprise could not succeed;
for the army was composed of conscripted men, and especially because the married men were going. The governor left Manila
October seventeen, with six royal galleys, one galleon, one fusta, one fragatin, and a number of fragatas, caracoas, and vireys&#8212;different
varieties of craft of the natives of the country. All the vessels, those belonging to his Majesty and those of his vassals
who offered their persons for his service, totaled one hundred. There were one thousand well-armed Spaniards and more than
four hundred arquebusiers from the vicinity of Manila; and another thousand <a id="d0e4229"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4229">257</a>]</span>of those called Visaias, people who use lances, shields, and bows and arrows. Besides these, there were more than four hundred
others, Chinese, of those living throughout that island; and of those who come to trade, another goodly number, with pay&#8212;the
great majority of whom were conscripts rather than volunteers. There was in the galleys a quantity of food for the fleet.
The governor appointed his son, Don Luys Perez, as lieutenant of the fleet, and ordered him, as above stated, to assemble
it at the island of Ceb&uacute;. He himself embarked in the flagship, a vessel of twenty-eight benches, manned by two hundred and
fifty Chinese; and eighty Spaniards also embarked in it. They reached Cabite, whence they sailed on the nineteenth, together
with several vessels carrying private persons, who followed the governor at their own expense. They coasted the island of
Manila, until they reached Balaj&agrave;n; then they separated, for the vessels did not lose sight of shore, while the governor sailed
in the open sea. On the twenty-fifth, he came alone to pass the night at the promontory of Azufre<a id="d0e4231src" href="#d0e4231" class="noteref">18</a> [&#8220;Sulphur Point&#8221;] on the island of Manila, opposite that of Ca&ccedil;a, where the current runs strong and the sea is choppy. As
it was during the blowing of the brisa, the galley could not advance. It anchored under shelter of the point, but, through
the strength of the current, dragged slightly. In order to return to its shelter, the Chinese were kept incessantly at the
oar. In fact, they rowed with little energy&#8212;either because they were men new to that labor, and forced to <a id="d0e4234"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4234">258</a>]</span>the oar by violence; or because they were fatigued, and harassed by those who commanded them. Other contrary winds assailed
them, which further impeded the voyage. In order to double certain promontories of the land, it was necessary to ply the oars,
and to urge on the rowers with the severity and punishment generally used in galleys. They thought that harsh, and contrary
to the governor&#8217;s assurance, when he promised them that they would be treated with affection. But neither the whip nor threats,
nor overcoming the currents by dint of the sweat of their limbs, seemed to them so intolerable and injurious as to hear from
the governor&#8217;s mouth harsh and severe words, ordering them to row manfully; for did they not, he would put them in chains,
and cut off their hair. Such an insult among the Chinese is worthy of death, for they place all their honor in their hair.
They keep it carefully tended and gaily decked, and esteem it as highly as ladies in Europa; and, in dressing it, display
their taste and their social standing. They determined to mutiny, in order not to suffer such an insult and disgrace. Having
appointed for that purpose the following night (namely, the twenty-fifth of October), when the Spaniards had lain down tired
out upon the benches, and in other places in the hull, the Chinese did the same. However, they so cunningly divided themselves
that each Chinese lay down beside a Spaniard, and pretended to sleep. Just before the hour of dawn, which they considered
the most suitable time and the safest of all, upon seeing the Spaniards in their soundest slumber, the Chinese, at the sound
of a shrill whistle (which was the signal agreed upon among them), all arose at the same moment; and <a id="d0e4236"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4236">259</a>]</span>each one with the greatest haste put on a white tunic or shirt, so that, in the midst of the uproar and the darkness, they
might recognize one another, and distinguish those to be killed. However, for the greater security of the deed, they also
lit a considerable number of wax tapers, which they had concealed in the folds of the white tunics. Then they seized their
catans, which are sharper and more curved than our cutlasses, and each Chinese commenced, without disturbing the silence,
to strike his neighboring Spaniard; and then, with the increase of their fury, to behead all those who were sleeping. More
than sixty had embarked on the flagship, among them the servants of the governor, and others, old soldiers, who in order to
oblige and accommodate him were enduring discomfort. They had been gambling all the night; and being tired, and because of
the excessive heat, were sleeping naked, some in the midship gangway, others on the benches, while the more favored ones,
to whom were given better quarters, slept aft. The governor went into his cabin to sleep. The Chinese proceeded to slaughter
those who, suspecting nothing, were sleeping; it was done so quickly that when some of those asleep in the stern awakened,
the other Spaniards were already dead. The guard did not perceive it, and such carelessness could admit of no excuse, for
they had been sufficiently warned, and examples had preceded. Some waked, but finding themselves wounded and confused, jumped
overboard, where most of them were drowned. Some&#8212;a very few&#8212;jumped overboard before being wounded, but they were also drowned,
although they were near shore, for they could not reach land because of the strength of the current. Twelve escaped, <a id="d0e4238"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4238">260</a>]</span>and many dead bodies were found on the beach. The Chinese, now grown bolder, seized the pikes that they had hidden under the
benches, and with outcries completed their treachery. The governor, who was sleeping below the hatchway, with a lantern or
candle, awaked. In order to awaken him, the Chinese themselves began purposely to make a greater noise; while they cried out
to him and begged him to come out and settle a quarrel among the &#8220;Castillas,&#8221; as they call the Spaniards. He, either for that
reason, or thinking that the galley was dragging as on other occasions, arose in his shirt, opened the hatchway, looked out,
and pushed his body half way through it. At that same time, the Chinese fell upon him with their cutlasses, and fatally wounded
him. They cleft his head, transfixed him with their pikes, and ran him through with more than barbaric ferocity. Perceiving
that his death was near at hand, he retired, and took the prayer-book of his order, which he always kept with him, and an
image of our Lady. Between those two refuges, which were later found bathed in his blood, he yielded up his life. However
he did not die immediately, for they found him later in his bed, tightly holding the image, where he bled to death. About
him were the bodies of Daniel Gomez de Leon, his valet, Pantaleon de Brito, Suero Diaz, Juan de Chaves, Pedro Maseda, Juan
de San Juan, Carrion Ponce, and Francisco Castillo&#8212;all servants of his&#8212;besides the bodies of four very valiant slaves, who
merited the same end. The outcome was not learned until dawn, for not one of the Chinese dared enter the governor&#8217;s room that
night, fearing lest a portion of the eighty Spaniards of the galley had taken refuge there, so cowardly did <a id="d0e4240"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4240">261</a>]</span>their guilt make them. The only survivors in the galley were Fray Francisco Montilla, a discalced religious of St. Francis,
and Juan de Cuellar, the governor&#8217;s secretary, who were sleeping below decks&#8212;where the Chinese, since they are so cowardly,
did not dare descend for three days, until after the fury of the first attack had ceased. Then they put them ashore on the
Ylocos coast, on the same island of Luzon, so that the natives would let them take water, and because the friar and the secretary
had made a certain compact with them, to surrender, if no harm was done them. The Chinese, assured that no other longtime
Christians were alive, commenced to cry out and rejoice loudly at having committed that deed, saying now they had no one to
fear.

</p>
<p>The Spaniards, who were in other boats, near the land, although they saw the lights, and indistinctly heard the noise from
the flagship, supposed that it was some unexpected work connected with the galley, or something of that sort. When they learned
what was happening, after a long interval, from those who escaped by swimming, they could not remedy it and consequently remained
quiet. They were but few, and of inadequate force, and their enterprise was ruined. They waited until the morning, and when
it dawned they saw that the galley had already set its bastard,<a id="d0e4244src" href="#d0e4244" class="noteref">19</a> and was sailing toward China with the wind astern, and they could not follow it. It made its voyage, as the wind served it,
along all the coast of the island, until they cleared Luzon, the Sangleys continuing to celebrate their victory.<a id="d0e4249src" href="#d0e4249" class="noteref">20</a>....
<a id="d0e4255"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4255">262</a>]</span></p>
<p>[The secretary and friar, after suffering great tortures of mind from the Chinese, who threatened often to kill them, are
saved at last, through the superstition of the Chinese, and left ashore on the Ilocos coast. The Chinese show their cowardice
in a conflict with the natives on that coast, whither they return later &#8220;to sacrifice to the demon&#8221; one of their Christian
Filipino prisoners. Being unable to reach China, they land at Cochinchina, &#8220;where the king of Tunquin seizes their cargo,
and two large pieces of artillery embarked for the expedition to Maluco, the royal standard, and all the jewels, ornaments,
and money. He let the galley drift ashore.&#8221; The news causes great lamentation in Manila. &#8220;Some of those who hated the governor
rejoiced, but their wrath immediately vanished and they wept generally.&#8221; Subsequent events follow:]

</p>
<p>... The news having been learned in Manila, and no papers of the governor being found, appointing his successor (although
it was known that he had a royal decree for this), and believing it had been lost in the galley along with much of his own
property, and that of the king and private persons: the city appointed Licentiate Rojas as governor, and he filled the post
for forty days. But the secretary, Juan de Cuellar, together with Fray Francisco de Montilla, returning in a wretched plight
to Manila, reported that Gomez Perez, before leaving, had left the appointment drawn in favor of his son, Don Luis; and that
they would find it in a box in the convent of St. Augustine with other papers, in care of Fray Diego Mu&ntilde;oz. Rojas had already
sent an order to Cebu for all the men of the expedition to return, which was obeyed. Thereupon Don Luis, having <a id="d0e4260"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4260">263</a>]</span>come, by virtue of the authority delegated by his father, although with certain protests, succeeded to that government, until
the arrival of Don Francisco Tello.

</p>
<p>Such was the end of that cavalier, whose achievements, judged by themselves, have worth, and receive worth also by his zeal
in performing them. He did not lack political and military virtues, or prudence in both. But he shut his eyes to examples,
and, contrary to their teaching, dared promise himself results, so that he became rash and even confident. But Christian charity
excuses all this.

</p>
<p>Don Luis, his kindred, and friends, wished to continue the expedition to Maluco, and Father Antonio Fernandez came for that
purpose from Tydore; but it was not carried out. The fleet was broken up, which was a signal providence for the Filipinas
Islands. For at the beginning of the following year, one thousand five hundred and ninety-four, a considerable number of Chinese
vessels, laden with men and arms, but no merchandise as was their wont, came to the islands. The vessels brought seven mandarins,
some of the greatest viceroys or governors of their provinces. It was rumored and was proved that when they learned that,
as Gomez Perez had undertaken that expedition (on which he had been accompanied by all the Spaniards), they would find the
country unarmed, they were of a mind to conquer it or sack it&#8212;which would have been very easy for them, had they found it
as they expected. The mandarins left their ships twice to visit Don Luis, attended by a great pomp and retinue. He received
them kindly, and gave each mandarin a gold necklace. They told him that they had come by order of <a id="d0e4266"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4266">264</a>]</span>their king to get the Chinese who were wandering unsettled among those islands without his leave. But this was considered
a pretext for the truth, for so many mandarins were unnecessary for it, or so many armed ships and supplies. Those Chinese
were the same as those who killed Gomez Perez, men from Chincheo. Accordingly Don Luis, as against a known offender, sent
his own cousin, Don Fernando de Castro, in a vessel to recount their treachery to the Chinese king; but the voyage turned
out badly, and this effort wholly failed.

</p>
<p>At this time Langara, king of Camboxa, requested help earnestly, and asked Don Luis to keep the promise that his father had
made him some time before. Consequently, in fulfilment of it, and so that those forces, or some portion of them, should continue
in the service of the Church, for which they were prepared as a benefit for Ternate, he determined to aid that king with them.

</p>
<p>[A description of Camboxa follows, with observations on its religion, wealth, products, industries, and fauna. The account
of the first expedition to that country is as follows:]

</p>
<p>Don Luis, with zeal to reduce those nations to the bosom of the Church, and their wealth and kings to the vassalage of the
Spanish crown, equipped three vessels. In them he sent Captain Juan Xuarez Gallinato&#8212;a native of Tenerife, one of the Canarias
Islands&#8212;with one hundred and twenty Spaniards, besides some Filipinos. They left Ceb&ugrave;, but a terrible storm immediately overtook
them, and separated the boats. Gallinato, borne by the fury of the winds, put in at Mal&aacute;ca, and the other two vessels at Camboxa.
They ascended the river, where they <a id="d0e4274"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4274">265</a>]</span>learned that the king of Sian had routed him of Camboxa, his neighbor. The latter, with the wretched remnants of his army,
fled to the kingdom of the Laos, also a neighboring people, but inhuman. While he was begging charity from those most hard-hearted
people, the king of Sian had introduced as king of Camboxa one Prauncar, nicknamed &#8220;Boca tuerta el Traydor&#8221; [<i>i.e.</i>, &#8220;Wry-mouth, the Traitor&#8221;], brother of the conquered king. This event did not hinder the aid that the Spaniards were bringing,
under the name of an embassy. They reached the city of Chordumulo, eighty leguas&#8217; distance from the bar. Leaving forty Spaniards
in the ships, forty others went to visit the place where the king was residing. They immediately made efforts to visit him,
but he refused to be seen that day. However, he ordered a good lodging to be given them and had them told that he would grant
them audience in three days. But Diego Veloso and Blas Ruyz&#8212;either by their former knowledge of the country, or actuated by
later craftiness, proceeding from their interpretation of that suspicious delay&#8212;visiting a beautiful Indian woman of the king&#8217;s
house, were secretly told by her that, since she was admitted to and even desired in the affairs of that usurper, she knew
that he was intending to have them all killed. In the three days that he had assigned them, as a rest from their journey,
he was preparing men, and the manner of executing his purpose. The Spaniards thanked her for the warning, not without promises
of reward. They were not dismayed at the news of their peril. On the contrary, thanking the Indian woman anew for it, they
took an heroic although rash decision. They agreed to invest the king&#8217;s palace that night, <a id="d0e4279"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4279">266</a>]</span>and if necessary, to resist a whole army. They set about the accomplishment of that enterprise, disproportionate to human
strength. They set fire to the powder magazine. The townspeople ran up to its aid, or to see the damage. Amid the confusion,
the Spaniards entered the palace, and since they knew the royal apartments, they penetrated them, until they encountered the
king in person. Having cut to pieces the soldiers of his guard, they killed him also with their daggers. He defended himself
and cried out, but when his men arrived with help they found that he had bled to death. The rumor of this deed aroused the
guard, and then the city, which has more than thirty thousand inhabitants. These seizing their arms, more than fifteen thousand
men pursued the Spaniards with the arms that fury placed in their hands, and with many armed elephants, which were not unskilled
in warfare. Our two captains formed their squadron, and continued to retire in excellent order, always fighting, and killing
not a few enemies. The battle lasted all night, and until the second day, when they reached the ships with incredible effort.
They embarked and left that kingdom full of new dissensions. The second day after, Gallinato arrived in his ship. He landed,
upon hearing of the event, as he thought that he would not be fulfilling his duty if, when he heard the drums and bells, and
saw the streets and port, before filled with traders, but now with squadrons, he did not take help to the Spaniards. He gave
express orders to his followers to act with all decorum, so that they might relieve the anxiety of the Cambodians and reassure
them, both by their bearing and in the calmness of their arguments. The chief men <a id="d0e4281"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4281">267</a>]</span>of Camboxa visited them peacefully, and Gallinato treated them very courteously. He might have performed some great exploit,
but seeing that he had so few troops for the undertaking, and that affairs had now taken another form and different condition,
he determined to withdraw. He opposed the majority of those influential men, who promised him the crown of the kingdom, since
they were well inclined to the Spaniards and to foreign domination. From this came that flippant report that Gallinato was
king of Camboxa, which was believed by many in Espa&ntilde;a; and it was represented in the theaters of that country with acclaim
and applause. Some men well versed in affairs of those provinces were of opinion that if Gallinato had embraced the opportunity,
he might have seized Camboxa and added it to the Spanish crown. I have seen letters from Velloso and Blas Ruiz to the Audiencia
of Manila after the event, in which they say the same, and complain of Gallinato for reprimanding what they did. But Gallinato&#8212;whose
prudence and valor, which had been proved on the most perilous occasions in that Eastern land, and many years before in the
wars of Flandes, would not allow him to be easily affected by popular applause&#8212;showing an honorable aversion to this temptation,
sailed away, to return to Manila. He took in provisions at Cauchinchina. Blas Ruyz and Diego Veloso had also landed there
before, and went alone overland to the kingdom of the Laos, which lies west of Cauchinchina, to find the deposed king Langara,
to restore him to his throne. They found that he was already dead, but that his son was living. Upon them telling him that
they had killed the usurper, his uncle and enemy, he went immediately to <a id="d0e4283"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4283">268</a>]</span>his kingdom with Veloso and Ruyz, accompanied by ten thousand men, whom the king of the Laos gave him, contrary to all expectations.
He attacked Camboxa, where Ruyz and Veloso always faithfully accompanied him, both during the war, and afterward in the government.
After that the king sent another embassy to Filipinas, asking for men to quiet the rebellions in the kingdom; and he and his
vassals promised to receive the faith of Jesus Christ. He also promised a great portion of Camboxa to the Spaniards, so that
they might live off its tributes. This embassy reached Manila, just when Don Luis had left the government and handed it over
to Don Francisco Tello, which gave occasion to Ternate to establish its tyrannies more firmly.

</p>
<p>[A short account of Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a&#8217;s fortification of Cartagena, in the West Indies, is given, and the consequent withdrawal,
without attack, of the Hawkins and Drake fleet despatched in 1595 by Queen Elizabeth. Acu&ntilde;a shows in every way the ability
of a good commander.]

</p>
<p>But let us return to Assia. The Cambodians still hoped to receive aid from the Filipinas by their usual promise of conversion
and vassalage. Don Luis de las Mari&ntilde;as accepted the expedition, to make it in person and at his own cost. He left Manila with
Don Diego Jordan (an Italian), Don Pedro de Figueroa, Pedro Villeatil, and Hernando de los Rios Coronel, Spanish captains&#8212;the
last named at present a priest, and who had also been in the first war of Camboxa. A furious tempest struck them in the open
sea, which lasted three days, with the usual horrors. The shipwreck was pitiful. Two vessels were knocked to pieces, and the
sea swallowed up all <a id="d0e4289"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4289">269</a>]</span>the men, provisions, and war materials. Of all the soldiers and sailors who shipped aboard the almiranta, only five escaped,
by swimming to the Chinese shore. Some soldiers also escaped from the flagship, which was broken by the waves, among whom
was Captain Hernando de los Rios. The other vessel reached Camboxa almost destroyed, after heavy storms. It found in the Camboxa
River eight Malay junks. The Spaniards, seeing that the junks were carrying certain slaves stolen from the king of Camboxa,
whom they were coming to help, inconsiderately grappled with the Malays. The latter, who were carrying many and unusual fire
devices, having recourse to these rather than to force and arms, burnt our ship, and then in the fire and smoke killed the
majority of the Spaniards. Blas Ruiz and Diego Veloso were not there at that time; but soon afterward they were besieged in
their quarters by the popular fury, and barbarously murdered in the country where they were negotiating with the king. Those
few Spaniards who could escape went to the kingdom of Sian, and thence to Manila. Heaven permitted that this should be the
end of all that preparation made to recover Ternate and the other Malucas. The tyrant there exulted over the news, and attributed
the events to his good fortune, interpreting them as an approbation of his cause. Then he confederated anew with our enemies.

</p>
<p>Don Francisco Tello, an Andalusian knight, succeeded Gomez Perez in the government of Filipinas. He reached Manila in the
year one thousand five hundred and ninety-six. He immediately set himself to learn the condition in which his predecessors
had left matters, and to provide aid for the garrisons. <a id="d0e4293"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4293">270</a>]</span>For, since the emperor of Japon had caused those glorious martyrdoms among the religious of the Order of St. Francis, in the
year one thousand five hundred and ninety-five, of which news had so lately been received, it was feared that he was going
to menace Filipinas.

</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the islands [<i>sic</i>] of Mindanao hate our nation as deeply as do the Ternatans, and take arms against us in each and every disturbance, as they
did in that last one of Ternate. Consequently Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa made certain agreements with Don Francisco Tello,
by virtue of which he made war on the Mindanaos and Ternatans at his own expense.<a id="d0e4300src" href="#d0e4300" class="noteref">21</a> Estevan Rodriguez was so rich that he could undertake that exploit with safety. He lived in Arevalo, a town of the island
of Pan&agrave;z [<i>sic</i>], one of the Filipinas. He set out with some galleys, fragatas, and champans, and one ship, with Spanish soldiers; and more
than one thousand five hundred natives from Pintados, as pioneers. He reached the river of Mindanao April twenty, one thousand
five hundred and ninety-six, whereupon the natives of the place (who are especially called Mindanaos) on seeing so brave a
people, fled along up the river, and abandoned their settlement to the fury of war. The majority of them arrived at the town
Buyahen, where Raxamura, king of the Mindanaos, was then living. The latter, because of his youthful age, did not have the
government in charge, and everything depended on Silonga, an esteemed soldier and captain. Our men, proceeding up the river,
reached Tampacan, five leguas from the above village. <a id="d0e4309"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4309">271</a>]</span>Prince Dinguilib&oacute;t, uncle of Monao, its legitimate lord (also a youth), was governing it. These <span class="corr" title="Source: ruler">rulers</span> were, of their own accord, friends to the Spaniards and consequently, on seeing their arms, went out peacefully to meet them,
and offered them their help. They told the Spaniards that the enemy&#8212;and they were also hostile to the men of Buyah&egrave;n&#8212;had taken
refuge in their fort at that place. Estevan Rodriguez, having heard the news and having complimented those princes, ordered
the fleet to weigh anchor and to continue the pursuit for four leguas, always up stream, to Buyah&egrave;n. Having arrived, he landed
his men on St. Mark&#8217;s day. Master-of-camp Juan de la Xara led the men, although they landed with but little order, for they
had not fought with the Mindanaos, and thought that it would be easy to rout them&#8212;as if for that reason, or for any other
consideration, one should permit a lack of military discipline. Estevan Rodriguez tried to correct the confusion by his presence,
by landing in person. He went clad in armor so strong, that a charge from an esmeril<a id="d0e4314src" href="#d0e4314" class="noteref">22</a> would not pass through it. Only his head was unarmed, but covered with a cap and plumes, while a negro carried his helmet.
He was accompanied by five well-armed soldiers. He had not taken more than fifty steps, when an Indian named Ubal suddenly
ran out of some dense tufted thickets, and, attacking him with his campilan, cleft open his head. Ubal was the brother of
Silonga, and owner of the only cow in all that country. He killed it three days previous to this misfortune, and, inviting
his friends to the feast, promised to kill the most distinguished person of the Spaniards in that <a id="d0e4317"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4317">272</a>]</span>war. He fulfilled his word, for Estevan Rodriguez fell, from his wound, and died three days afterward, without having answered
a single word to the questions asked him, although he declared his answers by signs. The five Spaniards, on seeing their captain
wounded&#8212;so suddenly that the murderer appeared and the blow was heard at the same moment&#8212;fell upon Ubal and cut him to pieces.
They informed Master-of-camp Xara of the general&#8217;s death, who, stifling his resentment, withdrew his men, and built a fort
in the most suitable place, near the river. He founded there his colony, with suitable arrangements, so that our people could
settle it. He appointed regidors and ministers of justice, and called it Nueva Murcia in honor of the Murcia of Espa&ntilde;a, his
native region. Then he left affairs incomplete, intending to marry the widow of Estevan Rodriguez, Do&ntilde;a Ana de Oseguera; and
reached Filipinas in the first part of June. Governor Don Francisco Tello, hearing of the event at El Embocadero,<a id="d0e4319src" href="#d0e4319" class="noteref">23</a> one hundred leguas from Manila, and having been warned of Xara&#8217;s design in coming, arrested him at his arrival, and sent
Captain Toribio de Miranda to take charge of the war in Mindanao. The latter found the troops withdrawn to the port of La
Caldera, which is on the same island, but distant thirty-six leguas from the mouth of the river. There they remained until
<a id="d0e4328"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4328">273</a>]</span>August, when Don Francisco Tello appointed Don Juan Ronquillo in Manila as captain; he was also captain of the galleys. He
also appointed as captains, to accompany him, Pedro Arceo, Covarrubias and others; as master-of-camp, Diego Chaves Ca&ntilde;izares;
as sargento-mayor, Garcia Guerrero; and as captains of infantry, Christoval Villagra and Cervan Gutierrez. Don Juan arrived
with this re&euml;nforcement to attack the enemy, and fell upon them so suddenly that, seeing themselves exhausted, they begged
help from the king of Ternate&#8212;whom the Mindanaos recognize by certain payments which are the same, or almost the same, as
tributes. Buiz&agrave;n, a brother of Silonga, went on that embassy to Ternate, and negotiated so efficaciously that the Ternate
king sent seven caracoas with him, six pieces of artillery, two medium-sized pieces, and some falcons, together with six hundred
men. These, sailing to the river of Mindanao, tried to ascend as far as Buyah&egrave;n by it. But they found at its mouths great
obstructions to pass, because in one branch the largest Spanish fort threatened them, and the galleys and other boats; and
in the other was a narrow pass, which ran to a point, on which was built a rampart guarded by forty men. From that place to
the other side of the river, our men had themselves built a very strong wooden bridge, close to which a galliot plied. The
Ternatans, seeing so strong a defense on both sides, resolved to fortify themselves on the chief mouth of the river. They
built a small fort, and, together with an equal number of Mindanao soldiers, shut themselves up in it. This news aroused General
Ronquillo to dislodge them. He went down to accomplish it with the galleys and other vessels, and <a id="d0e4330"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4330">274</a>]</span>one hundred and forty well-armed men. He landed with one hundred and sixteen men, together with Captains Ruy Gomez Arellano,
Garcia Guerrero, Christoval Villagra, and Alonso de Palma. He met the enemy at a distance of eighty paces on the bank of the
river. The Ternatans and Mindanaos had carefully cleared the front of their fort, but had designedly left a thicket at one
side of it, where three hundred Ternatans were ambushed, while the rest were inside the fortress. As both parties saw how
few of our men were attacking them, they grew ashamed of their fortress and ambush. Threatening our men insolently, they showed
themselves and advanced upon the Spaniards. They found so great opposition from our men that without using any stratagem,
or for no other reason beyond natural strength, at the first shock of battle nearly all the Ternatans were killed, and the
rest fled. Our men pursued them until they killed them all. The men of Tampaca, who had been neutral until then, in consideration
of the dealings of Fortune, and seeing that she had declared in our favor, took up arms for us. Only seventy-seven Ternatans,
badly wounded, escaped; and fifty of these were drowned in the river, into which they had thrown themselves in desperation.
Only three of the twenty-seven survived, and they informed their king of it. The Spaniards seized the boats, artillery and
spoils of she conquered, and became encouraged to continue the war against infidels.

</p>
<p>Don Francisco Tello was not neglectful of other similar occurrences. He learned by his spies, and rumor had it, that the emperor
of Japon was collecting a large army and preparing many boats for <a id="d0e4334"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4334">275</a>]</span>it, and large supplies of arms and food. It was also learned that he was securing himself, by treaty, from the Chinese, of
whom the Japanese, because of their natural enmity, live in fear. Hence they inferred that he was equipping himself to make
war outside his kingdoms. He had negotiated and concluded alliances with the king of Ternate, and with other neighbors who
were hostile to the Spanish crown. From all of those actions there resulted eager conjectures that all that tempest was threatening
the Filipinas, and particularly their capital, Manila. The governor prepared his forces, and under pretext of saluting that
barbaric emperor with a present, sent Captain Alderete to find out the truth. The ambassador left for Japon in July. At the
same time, Don Francisco sent the galleon &#8220;San Felipe&#8221; to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a with advice of those rumors. Those two vessels, that
of Alderete and the &#8220;San Felipe,&#8221; met in Japon, and the natives did not conceive well-disposed intents concerning them. Alderete
learned thoroughly the forces and designs of the Japanese, and his efforts were of use in clearing up the apprehensions prevalent
in Manila, and preventing unreasonable fears. He brought another splendid present to the governor, and both sides made provision
for any possible outcome.

</p>
<p>The Audiencia was again established in Manila in the year one thousand five hundred and ninety-eight, for King Filipo was
prudently conferring authority on that province. The auditors&#8212;Licentiates Zambrano, Mezcoa,<a id="d0e4338src" href="#d0e4338" class="noteref">24</a> and Tellez de Alma&ccedil;an&#8212;and Fiscal Geronymo Salazar y Salcedo, formed it.

</p>
<p>[The same year when the Audiencia was re&euml;stablished, <a id="d0e4343"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4343">276</a>]</span>Felipe II dies at the Escorial (September 13, 1598) and is succeeded by his son Felipe III. Neglect falls upon Molucca affairs:]

</p>
<p>... Now at this time Heaven was hastening the reduction of the Malucas, and the punishment of the persecution of the faithful,
although the tyrants acted more insolently. But since the enterprise had to be prepared and executed in the Filipinas Islands,
and determined and encouraged in the supreme Council of the Indias, it was advisable for the president and counselors to display
some warmth in the cause&#8212;which by unhappy circumstances, as one despaired of, no one enlivened; and the papers of discussion
and notices belonging to it were forgotten and heaped together....

</p>
<p>[Meanwhile the alliance of Ternate with the English continues. Book vi ends with a tale of occurrences in the household of
the king of Ternate.]

</p>
<p>[The greater part of the seventh book is taken up with the translation or condensation from the Dutch relation of the first
voyage of van Nek to the East Indies. A critical resume of Erasmus&#8217;s description of Holland and its people is given, which
allows Argensola, as a churchman and good Catholic, to inveigh against the heresies and many religions of the Dutch. As a
consequence of the Dutch expedition, the Ternatans gain new life in their opposition to the Portuguese and Spaniards. Frequent
embassies are sent to Manila from the Portuguese and natives at Tidore, requesting aid for the Moluccas&#8212;which Francisco Tello
was neglecting, as other matters appeared more important. One embassy, in charge of the brother of the king of Tidore, <a id="d0e4353"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4353">277</a>]</span>is followed by another in charge of a Portuguese, Marcos Diaz de Febra, who presents a letter from the Tidore ruler to Dr.
Morga. The embassy is successful, and in 1602 Diaz returns to Tidore with re&euml;nforcements and a promise of an expedition from
Manila. In the Philippines themselves, the Chinese are continually congregating in greater numbers, and are rapidly becoming
a menace, although the governor is blind to that fact, and claims that they are necessary to the well-being of the community.]

<h3>Conquest of the Malucas Islands</h3>
<h3>Book Eighth</h3>
<p>[Molucca affairs are given considerable attention in the administration of Governor Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a. The petitions for aid,
sent to the Philippines from those islands, continue. Tello is removed from the governorship, and Acu&ntilde;a sent to take his place.
The latter is received in Manila (May, 1602) with great rejoicing, as his merits and reputation are well known. Tello&#8217;s death
occurs in Manila while waiting to give his residencia. Acu&ntilde;a enters into affairs with great energy. The narrative continues
(p. 270):]

</p>
<p>... The new governor was pained at beholding the poverty of the royal chest and treasury, and himself under the obligation
of preserving the king&#8217;s and his own credit. The Malucas formed part of this consideration, for their reduction was a considerable
part of his duty. But he reassured himself, believing that he might supply the lack of money by energy. He attended to matters
personally, as was his custom, both those in Manila and those in <a id="d0e4364"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4364">278</a>]</span>its vicinity. He built galleys and other boats, which were greatly needed for the defense of the sea, which was then infested
by pirates and near-by enemies, especially the Mindanaos. He visited then the provinces of Pintados, and attended to the needs
of those regions. In one of these visits, besides the storms suffered by his little vessel (which carried only three soldiers),
another signal danger overtook him. Twenty-two English vessels, enriched with the booty that they had seized from the islands
of that government, tried to attack and capture him. But for lack of a tide they remained stranded, and could not row. Don
Pedro saw that they threw overboard more than two thousand of their many Spanish and islander captives in order to lighten
themselves. They also threw overboard a beautiful Spanish girl seventeen years old. Later, the Manila fleet went in pursuit
of them, and it was able to capture some of the pirates, and they were punished. But that punishment was much less than their
cruelty.<a id="d0e4366src" href="#d0e4366" class="noteref">25</a> Don Pedro tried to remove the hindrances to the enterprise that he was meditating; but had to delay for some months what
he most wished to hasten, in order to despatch Joloan and Japanese matters.

</p>
<p>Chiquiro, the Japanese ambassador, had recently arrived in Manila, bearing a present of the products and industries of those
kingdoms, and letters; he also had orders to negotiate for friendship with the governor, and commerce between the Japanese
emperor (by name Daifusama) and the Filipinas and Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. The proximity of those provinces, the power of the Japanese
kings, their natural dispositions, <a id="d0e4371"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4371">279</a>]</span>and other circumstances which experience showed to be worthy of serious consideration, demanded that that commerce be not
refused&#8212;although, for the same reasons, the opinion was expressed that it was not advisable. But since that barbarian had
once espoused that desire, it was not easy to find a means to settle the matter without causing jealousy or anger. Dayfusama
requested then that the Spaniards trade in Quanto, a port of one of his own provinces; that they establish friendship, so
that the Japanese could go to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a; that the governor send him masters and workmen to build ships for him in Japon,
in order to continue that navigation. Dayfusama insisted upon this, having been persuaded by one of our religious of the Order
of St. Francis, one Fray Geronymo de Jesus, whom the Japanese king esteemed greatly. This was a serious matter, and in many
ways most damaging to the Filipinas. In those islands, the greatest security against those provinces has consisted for many
years in the lack of ships and pilots among the Japanese, together with their ignorance of the art of navigation. It has been
observed by experts that, whenever that insolent barbarian has shown any intention to arm against Manila, he has been prevented
by this obstacle. Consequently to send him workmen and masters to build Spanish vessels for him, would be equivalent to providing
him weapons against the Spaniards themselves; and the navigation of the Japanese would be the prelude to the destruction of
Filipinas and Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, while long voyages by the Japanese were inadvisable, and moreover contrary to safety. Considering
all these reasons, Governor Don Pedro de <a id="d0e4373"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4373">280</a>]</span>Acu&ntilde;a ordered the ambassador Chiquiro to be entertained splendidly. He gave him some presents for his king and for himself,
and despatched a vessel with another present&#8212;a moderate one, so that it might not argue fear, as it would if he took too much.
It sailed together with the ship of Dayfusama and his ambassador, both being filled with articles of barter. The letters of
Don Pedro contained long compliments at his pleasure in procuring the establishment of greater friendship. But he said that,
although he had received full power from King Filipe for things pertaining to the government of Filipinas, that part of the
king&#8217;s embassy touching his request for sailors and the building of Spanish ships he was unable to decide, until he should
inform the viceroy of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a; nor could the viceroy decide it without special orders from his Majesty. He promised the
Japanese king to write about it for him, and to aid the accomplishment of so just a desire. But he warned him that it would
be necessary to wait more than three years for the furtherance and resolution of the matter, because of the distance and accidents
of so long voyages. It was ordered that the same Fray Geronymo himself should deliver all this message to Dayfusama. Geronymo
de Jesus was written to in secret, instructing and reproving him. He was ordered to tell the Japanese monarch that the governor
esteemed his good will exhibited toward the commerce and friendship of the Spaniards, and his own great desire for them. He
was to encourage him to keep the peace, which the governor himself would keep without any infringement. But he was ordered
subtly to divert the king&#8217;s mind from similar desires and propositions, and not to <a id="d0e4375"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4375">281</a>]</span>facilitate any of them; for although perhaps there were no hidden deceit in the then reigning monarch, or any interest greater
than that of friendship, it might cause great harm in times of a less well-intentioned successor, who might abuse the navigation,
and turn it against those who taught it to them. The governor promised to send another ship soon to trade. Fray Geronymo was
to give the king hopes that some Spanish masters of Spanish boats would sail in it. Dayfusama was to be patient, and should
consider how offended he would be, if his servants were to open up any new commerce without consulting him, or without his
order.

</p>
<p>With this despatch Chiquiro returned to Japon in his ship....

</p>
<p>[A storm however overtakes him near Formosa, and his ship is wrecked and he and his men drowned, the event being learned only
long after. &#8220;Daifusama, being persuaded by Fray Geronymo, had granted leave for our religion to be preached in his kingdoms,
to build our churches, and for all who wished to profess our religion with public authority.&#8221; Accordingly the orders send
various missionaries to different districts of Japan. &#8220;Many persuaded Don Pedro not to send away these religious, but, although
those persuasions were well founded, and obstacles put in the way of their departure, it was determined to allow them to go....
These religious did not find in the provinces proof of the desires that had been told them. Very few Japanese were converted,
and fewer were disposed toward it, for the king and tonos [chiefs] ... did not love our religion.&#8221; Don Pedro sends the promised
ship to Japan laden with &#8220;dye-wood, deerskins, <a id="d0e4381"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4381">282</a>]</span>raw silk, and various other articles.&#8221; Thus Japanese demands are met, and the emperor is satisfied with the diplomatic answer
returned to him. Meanwhile &#8220;Don Pedro&#8217;s thought bore on the recovery of the Malucas.&#8221; Letters pass between him and the Portuguese
commander Andrea Furtado de Mendoza in regard to the expedition, and aid from the Philippines, and the hostilities of the
Dutch. (The Jesuit brother Gaspar Gomez had been sent by Acu&ntilde;a from Mexico to Spain, to show the necessity and advantages
of the expedition; after various delays it was set on foot, and Furtado obtained many successes in Amboina, where he had some
encounters with the Dutch. The king of Ternate asked help from Java and Mindanao.)]

</p>
<p>The season and necessity compelled General Furtado to request urgently the help that was being prepared in Filipinas. Amboino
is eighty leguas from those islands. Accordingly he sent Father Andres Pereyra, a Jesuit, and Captain Antonio Brito Foga&ccedil;o,
in May of the year one thousand six hundred and two. They reached Ceb&ugrave; July twenty-five. They sailed thence for Manila, August
six, and entered that city September five. Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a rejoiced greatly over their arrival. He asked them&#8212;so great
was his desire and interest, or rather, his noble rivalry&#8212;minutely concerning the expeditions of General Furtado. Since the
latter had referred to them in his letters, they gave an extended relation of them, and executed his embassy, each one fulfilling
the office that he professed. Don Pedro did not delay the sending [of re&euml;nforcements.] He assembled the council of war, where
it was resolved to send Furtado the help that he requested, without <a id="d0e4385"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4385">283</a>]</span>delay, although they felt obliged to accommodate themselves to the necessities of the country. Following this decision the
governor sent a message to the provinces of Pintados ordering captain Juan Xuarez Gallinato, chief of them, to provide all
necessaries for the expedition, and himself to sail with his best disciplined infantry from Ceb&ugrave; to the city of Arevalo, the
place assigned for assembling the fleet. Gallinato did this, and also sent a vessel to Ot&oacute;n to lade as much as possible of
the supplies. It reached Ot&oacute;n October twenty-eight, and the same day Don Pedro left Manila for Pintados, in order, by his
presence, to inspire greater haste in the despatch of the fleet, which was already almost ready in Ot&oacute;n. He arrived there
November thirteen. So fiery was his spirit that he assembled the re&euml;nforcement and entrusted it to Juan Xuarez Gallinato&#8212;without
allowing the expeditions from Xolo and Mindanao to embarrass him, even though he saw the natives of those islands, divided
into different bodies among the Pintados, pillaging and murdering his Majesty&#8217;s vassals&#8212;and appointed him general and commander
of that expedition.

</p>
<p>[Furtado, after asking the re&euml;nforcement from Acu&ntilde;a, goes to the Moluccas. Some of his men are defeated in a naval engagement
with the natives, whereupon Furtado builds a fort at the friendly island of Machian.]

</p>
<p>After the fleet, military stores and food had been collected, they were delivered to Gallinato by the auditors and fiscal
of the Audiencia. The supplies consisted of one thousand fanegas of cleaned rice, three hundred head of cattle, two hundred
jars of wine, eighty quintals of nails and bolts, forty quintals <a id="d0e4391"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4391">284</a>]</span>of powder, three hundred Ylocos blankets, seven hundred varas of Castilian wool, one hundred sail-needles, and thirty jugs
of oil. The men amounted to two hundred soldiers&#8212;one hundred and sixty-five arquebusiers and thirty-five musketeers&#8212;twenty-two
sailors, several pilots, one master, three artillerymen in the &#8220;Santa Potenciana,&#8221; and twenty common seamen. The monthly expense
of all that equipment amounted to twenty-two thousand two hundred and sixty pesos. This having been done on the part of the
governor and Audiencia, they required Father Andres Pereyra and Captain Brito to go with the re&euml;nforcement&#8212;which Gallinato
had ready, with its colors, and with Captains Christoval Villagr&agrave; and Juan Fernandez de Torres. The company of Captain Don
Tomas Bravo, the governor&#8217;s nephew, son of Don Garcia his brother, was left behind; but the captain went, and served bravely
on the expedition. The infantry was taken on the ship &#8220;Sancta Potenciana,&#8221; and on the fragatas &#8220;Santo Anton,&#8221; &#8220;San Sebastian,&#8221;
&#8220;San Buenaventura,&#8221; and &#8220;San Francisco.&#8221; The fleet left the port of Yloilo January twenty, one thousand six hundred and three,
and reached La Caldera in Mindanao the twenty-fifth. They remained there until the twenty-eighth, as they had some information
concerning those enemies. Then they sailed toward Maluco, and sighted the island of Siao February seven, and at dawn of the
next day that of Taol&acirc;n, four leguas from Siao. There the fragata &#8220;Sant Anton&#8221; was wrecked on a shoal of the island, which
gave greater anxiety to the fleet. Gallinato made efforts so that the men should not perish. He sent Captain Villagr&agrave;, who
saved them, as well as the weapons and the pieces of artillery; <a id="d0e4393"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4393">285</a>]</span>the rest was left in the sea. They continued their voyage and sighted the island of Ternate February thirteen. On the fourteenth
they entered that of Tydore, where they heard of Andres Furtado&#8217;s arrival. There they rested but little, in order to join
him sooner. Sailing thence with a good breeze they reached Ternate, and made harbor at Talangame, one legua from the fortress,
on the sixteenth of the same month. The fleets saluted one another with tokens of friendly regard, and the generals did the
same....

</p>
<p>[The active campaign soon begins, and notwithstanding some few successes in the siege of Ternate by Furtado and Gallinato,
sickness, and want of ammunition and provisions, compel the Portuguese commander to withdraw before the superior forces and
equipment of the Ternatans. Thereupon Gallinato and his men return to the Philippines via Tidore, while Furtado intends going
to Amboina and perhaps to Malaca. About April of this same year the Jesuit brother, Gaspar Gomez, reaches Spain, to argue
before the Council of the Indias the necessity of an effective expedition from the Philippines. There it is agreed that Acu&ntilde;a
shall undertake one in person. The following year a letter received from Acu&ntilde;a by the council describes the ill-success of
Furtado&#8217;s expedition and the necessity for an effective expedition from the Philippines, a synopsis of the letter being given
by our author.]

<h3>Conquest of the Malucas Islands</h3>
<h3>Book Ninth</h3>
<p>[The action of the council finally secured the king&#8217;s <a id="d0e4404"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4404">286</a>]</span>assent to the Molucca expedition, and the following decree was sent to Acu&ntilde;a:]

</p>
<p>... Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a, my governor and captain-general of the Filipinas Islands, and president of my royal Audiencia therein.
On September twenty of the past year, six hundred and three, I wrote you by an advice-boat on which Gaspar Gomez, of the Society
of Jesus, took passage for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, my resolution in regard to what you wrote me from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, when you went to
take charge of that office, about the Ternate expedition. In accordance with that resolution, I have ordered a contingent
of five hundred men to be collected in these kingdoms, which are to be conveyed in the trading fleet that sails to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a
this year. I wrote to the viceroy to have another five hundred men enlisted so that, at the very least, eight hundred men
could be sent you for this enterprise. I have appointed four captains for the contingent from these kingdoms. One of them,
namely, Admiral Juan de Esquivel, is to be commander and governor of the said soldiers. I have also appointed six substitutes,
practiced and experienced soldiers, so that, in case any of the said captains die, these may take command of the men, and
that they may be in charge of the companies to be raised in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, as I am writing to the viceroy. I have assigned
forty ducados per month as pay to the said captains; to Admiral Juan de Esquivel the sum of sixty; and to the substitutes,
twenty-five escudos apiece until ahey reach Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. Thenceforward the said Juan de Esquivel, in case I order him to
be given the title of master-of-camp, shall enjoy the sum of one hundred and twenty ducados per month; but if he <a id="d0e4408"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4408">287</a>]</span>serves with the title of commander and governor of the said soldiers, he shall have sixty. The substitutes shall receive forty;
and the soldiers&#8212;both those levied in Espa&ntilde;a and those to be raised in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a&#8212;shall have the sum of eight ducados per
month. I have ordered the viceroy, in accordance with the above, to send to those islands the necessary money to meet the
pay of the soldiers for one year. If they are detained longer in other affairs of my service, he shall also furnish what may
be necessary after advice from you. I have thought it best to advise you of the above, in order to charge and order you that,
if the pay of the soldiers can be moderated, in respect to what is there paid men of that rank, you may reform the schedule
justifiably, advising me thereof, and the viceroy of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. However, you shall make no alteration in the pay of Admiral
Juan de Esquivel, or of the captains, alf&eacute;rezes, or substitutes. I have also ordered the viceroy to provide you with whatever
may be necessary, up to the amount of the one hundred and twenty thousand ducados that you have asked for this undertaking;
also six pieces of artillery for bombardment, and five hundred quintals of arquebus powder. The men sent from here are armed
with muskets and arquebuses. You shall be careful in the distribution of this money, and in all the rest you shall exercise
the advisable care, system, and caution. You shall endeavor to attain the end sought, as I confidently expect from you, with
the men sent from Espa&ntilde;a, and those from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, together with those whom you shall have collected in those islands
for the expedition to Ternate. If possible, you shall make the expedition in person, as you have <a id="d0e4410"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4410">288</a>]</span>offered to do, and shall leave those islands provided as it fitting. In case conditions are such that you cannot go in person,
on this expedition, then you shall appoint another man of the experience and qualities requisite for it, who may take entire
charge of it; and for this I grant you authority. It is my will that, in case of your death while on the expedition, or through
any other cause, or the death of the person whom you may appoint for it, Admiral Juan de Esquivel succeed in it and continue
it. All the sea and land forces who shall take part in the said expedition, shall obey him as they would yourself. I declare
that, in this event, and in case of your death, and the succession of the said Juan de Esquivel to the charge of the expedition,
he shall be subject and subordinate to my royal Audiencia in those islands. The captains in whose charge is the infantry raised
in these kingdoms, I have selected as worthy men who have served. Accordingly I charge and order you chat you honor and favor
them as far as possible, for in that I shall consider myself served. You shall not dismiss them or deprive them of their companies
to give these to others, without just cause, unless it be to appoint them to better offices. However, if they should commit
crimes you may punish them, as their superior. It is supposed that by the time of the arrival of these soldiers at those islands&#8212;and
they shall leave Nueva Espa&ntilde;a in the first vessels, after the arrival of the trading fleet there&#8212;you will have matters so
well in hand that you may begin the expedition immediately. I charge you straitly to do with circumspectness, consideration,
and caution what I expect from so gallant a soldier. These men are to be well disciplined and drilled, and everything <a id="d0e4412"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4412">289</a>]</span>so ordered that the desired and so important effect may be gained, for you see the risk in this and its expense. You shall
endeavor, as I charge you, to have the advisable care and order taken in the efficient distribution and collection of my revenues,
and the avoidance of superfluous expense. Of the course of events you shall keep me advised on all occasions. After recovering
the fort of Ternate, you shall place there and on the island the garrison necessary for its safety. I have ordered the viceroy
of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, if he has any opportunity for it, to advise you as soon as the men raised here arrive there [<i>i.e.</i>, in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a], and that he report clearly to you the contingent enlisted in that country, and that will be raised in
any other way, as well as the time that they will leave there, so that you may take the necessary precautions concerning them
from those islands. If you consider it advisable for these men to stop anywhere and not to go to Manila, you shall so order
it, or give any other orders that you deem most advisable, in anything. Valladolid. June twenty, one thousand six hundred
and four.

</p>
<p>After the above decree was sent, its dispositions began to be carried out in Espa&ntilde;a. Before this, in the preceding year one
thousand six hundred and three, while governor Don Pedro was occupied in the preparations necessary for this purpose [<i>i.e.</i>, of the expedition], an accident occurred in Filipinas which threatened their loss and other greater misfortunes. In the
month of April a fire broke out in Manila and burnt the richest part and more than half of the city, and it was impossible
to keep the goods from burning which had been discharged from the ships recently arrived from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a <a id="d0e4422"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4422">290</a>]</span>which were being kept in the most secure of the houses. Two hundred and seventy houses, wood and stone, were burned, and even
the monastery of St. Dominic (both house and church), the royal Spanish hospital, and the magazines; and not a single edifice
was left standing in the burned area. Fourteen Spaniards were burned, among whom was Licentiate Sanz, canon of the cathedral,
together with some Indians and negroes. The loss was estimated at one million....

</p>
<p>[The incident of the coming of the three Chinese mandarins and their pretense of looking for an island of gold is described.
This with certain rumors, readily believed, leads to the outbreak of feeling against the Chinese or Sangleys resident in Manila
and other parts of the island. That same year (1603), the insurrection by them takes active shape. Argensola&#8217;s account is
substantially the same as that of other writers. He traces the insurrection during its rise, and progress, and the retreat
of the Sangicys, with the consequent slaughters of those people. The following extracts and synopses are made from his account:]

</p>
<p>At the time when Covernor Don Pedro was attending most closely to the war with Maluco, there occurred in Manila a circumstance
such that it might not only have suspended the war, but extinguished the entire province. A man was residing in Manila who
had remained there when the great pirate Limaon (of whose history popular accounts are current) came against the city. He
was formerly an idolater, and, as was reported, served the pirate for a lewd purpose. His name was Enc&agrave;n, and he was a native
of Semygua in the province of Chincheo. <a id="d0e4428"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4428">291</a>]</span>He was baptized during Santiago de Vera&#8217;s term, and took the latter&#8217;s surname, being called Baptista de Vera. He proved sagacious,
industrious, and of efficacious energy, by means of which, exercising his trading, he came to possess great wealth and to
have influence with the governors of Filipinas. Through his arrangements the Sangleys negotiated with Don Pedro, asking his
consent to finish a parapet of the wall that he was completing, at their own cost; for they, as a portion of the commonwealth,
wished to do this service for his Majesty. Each of them offered four reals for the work. This service and the thanks of the
citizens, whom Enc&agrave;n or Baptista had bought by benefits, destroyed or decreased the suspicions conceived against their conspiracy.
He was respected by the Spaniards and loved by the Sangleys. He had twice been their governor, and had many adopted sons and
dependents.... Near the Pari&aacute;n was another district inhabited by Japanese, a race hostile to the Sangleys, with whom they
are at constant war in their own country. The governor summoned their headmen, and sounded them by kind methods, as he wished
to know how to depend on them on any occasion, and if they would help against the Chinese if war came. The Japanese, puffed
up by the confidence that he placed in them, and elated that time would give them an opportunity to fight against their enemy,
answered that they were ready to die with the Spaniards. Some trouble arose from this wise effort, and as the Japanese kept
the secret badly, or referred to it with exaggeration, it became public that Don Pedro was going to kill the Sangleys with
their help. Some of the Japanese told them that, so that the Sangleys could flee and <a id="d0e4430"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4430">292</a>]</span>pay them for the warning. Many Sangleys tried to take to the mountains, while all were in fear. Those who wished to revolt
were able to persuade the others to do the same, and to quiet the anxious by promises. In fact, the greater portion of them
determined to rebel, and assigned St. Francis&#8217; day for the beginning of the insurrection, at the hour when the Christians
would be busied in their churches, in the holy feast. Some said that the time assigned for it was during the night, when twenty-five
thousand of them would enter the city and behead our men. Some indications of it escaped, notwithstanding their secrecy. Juan
de Talavera, parish priest of the hamlet of Quiapo, informed the archbishop that an Indian woman, with whom a Sangley was
in love, had revealed to him the plot for St. Francis&#8217;s day.... All these advices and some others were learned immediately
by the governor and the royal Audiencia. It would be sufficient to see the haste with which the Chinese sold everything, even
to their shoes, and adjusted their debts&#8212;although this was interpreted rather as a design to go away than one of treason.
In order to relieve them from fear of the Spaniards and Japanese, the governor talked to them himself, and had the pledge
of safety and the royal faith published anew in all districts. But no effort could quiet them. Three days before that of St.
Francis, more than four hundred Anhay merchants remained in the city, because they had been unable to sell their goods. These,
upon seeing the others in confusion because of the report that the Spaniards and Japanese were about to kill them, sent their
embassy to Don Pedro by one Chic&agrave;n, also an Anhay or Chincheo.... He came at night, being <a id="d0e4432"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4432">293</a>]</span>in fear of the other Chinese. He communicated their fears to the governor and their present uncertainty; and stated that they
did not know what resolution to take, and consequently came to him for advice and protection. The governor, after hearing
him and having completely assured him with his answer, went next day personally to talk to Chic&agrave;n&#8217;s companions, and satisfied
them with affectionate words, saying that the Spanish nation is not accustomed to execute or to consent to such deceits. After
this talk they were quieted, but those who had evil intentions were not satisfied....

</p>
<p>[At the first outbreak of the insurrection, Enc&agrave;n is sent to reassure and quiet the Sangleys. He returns very late &#8220;telling
Don Pedro that he had been in danger of being elected their chief, and that they wished to force him to accept it.&#8221; In the
slaughter of Don Luis Dasmari&ntilde;as and his men which soon follows, over thirty Spaniards manage to escape. The Japanese aid
the Spaniards, while the Sangleys try to induce all their countrymen of the Parian to join them.]

</p>
<p>The few Sangleys in the Pari&aacute;n caused the Spaniards no less anxiety than the many in the fort, both because they had them
for so near neighbors and as they supposed that if these saw our cause declining, they would join their countrymen. Besides,
it was known that the insurgents had sent to ask those in the Pari&aacute;n to join them, and had advised them of the Spaniards whom
they had killed. This was declared by a Sangley, who was caught while crossing the river by swimming, by the sentinel of the
river-boats. He, confessing, when put to the torture, that he was a spy, and that he gave and carried messages, was beheaded.
<a id="d0e4438"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4438">294</a>]</span>On the other side, it was considered that although it would lessen the anxiety to kill all the Sangleys or to attempt it,
it did not appear a just punishment toward people of whose crime they were uncertain&#8212;much more so, since they had come to
Filipinas to conduct their trading in good faith, and the governor had given them his word for their safety if they were quiet
and did not mix in the rebellion....

</p>
<p>[It is finally resolved to induce the peaceful Sangleys to take refuge in the Augustinian convent. However, they refuse to
take advantage of the offer, although some put their goods in safety. Meanwhile the hostile Sangleys attempt to incite them
to join their ranks, and on their refusal, turn upon them &#8220;and kill more than two hundred.&#8221; Enc&agrave;n is found concealed in a
house for fear of capture, whereupon he confesses his part in the rebellion. The religious take up arms against the insurgents,
notable among them being Fray Antonio Flores, an Augustinian lay-brother, and formerly a soldier: he is credited with having
slain six hundred Sangleys in the final slaughter. The Chinese, after driving in an attacking party of five hundred men under
Gallinato, assault the walls of the city, but are finally driven back with great slaughter. Their Pari&aacute;n is burned, and they
begin their retreat, going to San Pablo and other districts, pursued by the Spaniards and natives, who kill immense crowds
of them and disperse the rest. Spaniards, Japanese, and Pampangos are sent out under Sargento-mayor Azcueta, and the insurrection
is crushed with terrible slaughter; &#8220;for the Japanese and natives are so ferocious that nothing can restrain them.&#8221; The final
result of the last campaign <a id="d0e4442"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4442">295</a>]</span>shows that only &#8220;slightly more than one hundred [of the Sangleys] survived, who were kept alive for the galleys. Eight natives
and six Japanese died on our side in these two battles [<i>i.e.</i>, the slaughters of the pursuit]. No Spaniard was killed, although many were wounded.&#8221; Enc&agrave;n is &#8220;hanged and quartered, his
head exposed on the site of the Pari&aacute;n, and his goods confiscated; and in the days following, justice gave the same punishment
to other guilty Chinese.&#8221; The insurrection costs the lives of more than twenty-three thousand Chinese and only five hundred
are left for the galleys. &#8220;Some say that the number of Sangleys killed was greater, but in order that the illegality in admitting
so many into the country contrary to royal prohibitions might not be seen, the officials concealed or diminished the numbers
of those that perished.&#8221;]

</p>
<p>Don Pedro had had some advices of how well affected his Majesty was to the enterprise of Maluco. Awaiting the effects of that
decision, he wrote by all the ways possible; and by India, to solicit those who had charge of the matter. Relieved from the
hindrance caused by the Sangleys, he turned his mind to the preparation and equipment of the fleet, for the time when he should
be ordered to set out. But the end of this war was the beginning of other needs for Manila. Mechanical trades were stopped,
and there was no work or provisions. Prices of food increased with their lack. All supplies had been formerly in great abundance,
and were obtained through the Sangleys, for the Indian natives lack the willingness and the energy for such work. The cultivation
of the land, the care of raising fowls, the weaving of cloth, all of which industries they had exercised in their old <a id="d0e4449"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4449">296</a>]</span>days of infidelity, they had forgotten. Especially was the Pari&agrave;n or Alcayceria wasted by fire and sword. It was once so full
of gain and abundance that Don Pedro wrote to one of his relatives in Espa&ntilde;a, a short time after his arrival at Manila, these
following words of it: &#8220;This city is remarkable for the size of its buildings, which have surprised me. I shall mention only
one, which is the chief one. It has an Alcayceria that contains all kinds of silks and gold, and mechanical trades; and for
these things there are more than four hundred shops, and generally more than eight thousand men who trade therein. When the
trading fleets come from China with their merchandise, which is the present time of the year, there are always more than thirteen
or fourteen thousand men. They bring wonderful things, that are not found in Europa.&#8221; Besides this, Don Pedro feared that
the chastisement inflicted in the slaughter would discourage the intercourse of the Sangleys with us, and that the vessels
that were wont to come from China with food would not come. Greater and universal was the fear that in place of trading ships,
armed vessels would come to avenge the Sangleys. Don Pedro sent the prior of Manila, Fray Diego de Guevara, to Espa&ntilde;a by way
of India, with advices of the deed and of his fears. The incidents that befell him on his voyage in India itself, and in Persia,
Turquia, and Italia, forced him to delay three years before he could reach the court, where he found other despatches already
arrived.

</p>
<p>At the same time Don Pedro sent Captain Marcos de la Cueva, together with Fray Luis Gandullo, a Dominican, to Macao&#8212;a city
of China, where Portuguese reside&#8212;with letters for the commandant and <a id="d0e4453"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4453">297</a>]</span>council of that city, advising them of the rebellion of the Sangleys, and of its result, so that they might advise him by
all ways, at any rumor of an armed fleet in China. They took letters also for the tutons, haytaos, and inspectors of the provinces
of Canton and Chincheo, giving account of the transgression of the Chinese, and how it obliged the Spaniards to inflict so
severe a punishment. The ambassadors found the country quiet upon their arrival, although some fugitive Sangleys, fleeing
from Manila in champans, had related the disturbances among them. The arrival of those Spanish at Macao was learned in Chincheo.
Immediately some of the most wealthy captains who ordinarily go to Manila, whose names were Guans&agrave;n, Sin&uacute;, and Guachuan, went
to see them. Having understood the truth of the matter, they took upon themselves [the delivery of] the message sent to the
mandarins by Don Pedro, and the mandarins received it by their means. The Chincheo merchants determined to return to their
trade at Filipinas, and left Macao in their vessels with our ambassadors, taking a quantity of powder, saltpeter and lead,
with which the public magazines were supplied. In the following May, thirteen Chinese ships made port at Manila, and afterward
many others returned thither to continue that commerce. Don Pedro sent to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a the vessels that had brought the relief
for the islands. The flagship foundered and not a person or a plank escaped.  He did not cease at this time to store the city
with provisions and ammunition, in order to find himself free for the expedition to Maluco. At this juncture, Master-of-camp
Juan de Esquivel came from Mexico with six hundred soldiers, with the report that more men, money, and <a id="d0e4455"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4455">298</a>]</span>other preparations of arms, food, and ammunition were being collected in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, at the order of his Majesty; these
all arrived at Manila in due season. At that time died its great archbishop, Don Miguel de Benavides, to the universal sorrow
of the country.

</p>
<p>The Chinese ships that returned for the trade bore letters to the governor in reply to his despatch. Three letters of one
tenor came from the tuton or viceroy, the haytao, and the inspector-general of the province of Chincheo. Translated by the
interpreters into Spanish, they read as follows:

</p>
<p>[See this letter in <span class="smallcaps">Vol</span>. XIII, pp. 287&#8211;291 of this series.]

</p>
<p>The governor answered these letters by the same messengers, making use of terms of courtesy and authority.<a id="d0e4466src" href="#d0e4466" class="noteref">26</a>  He related the rebellion of the Sangleys from its inception. He justified the defense of the Spaniards, and the punishment
inflicted upon the delinquents. He says that no community can govern without punishing those who are evil, any more than by
not rewarding the blameless. Consequently he does not repent of what was done, as it was to check him who was trying to destroy
us. The inspector should consider what he should do, if any similar case happened in China. What he was sorry for was in not
having been able to save any of the Anhays among the Sangley merchants, who perished among the guilty. But it was impossible
to prevent that, <a id="d0e4472"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4472">299</a>]</span>for the violence of war does not allow some to be killed and others exempted, especially since they were unknown to the soldiers
in the heat of war. Employing clemency toward those captured alive, he condemned them to row in the galleys, which is the
punishment substituted by the Castilians for those who merit death. However, if they in China thought that the punishment
should be lessened, he would give them liberty. &#8220;But it should be noted,&#8221; says Don Pedro, &#8220;that this might be the cause that,
if so serious a crime were unpunished, they would fall into it a second time, a thing that would close all the gates to kindness.
The goods of the Chinese killed are in deposit. And in order that it may be seen that I am not moved by any other zeal than
that of justice, I shall have these immediately delivered to their heirs, or to those to whom they rightfully pertain. I am
not moved to any of these things by any consideration other than that of right. To tell me that if I do not free the prisoners,
permission will be given, to the relatives in China of those who were killed in the rebellion, to come with a fleet to Manila,
causes no disturbance in my mind; for I consider the Chinese as so sensible a race, that they will not be incited to such
things with little foundation and especially since we have; on our side, given them no occasion for it. In case any other
resolution is followed, we Spaniards are people who know how to defend our rights, religion, and country very well. And do
not let the Chinese consider themselves lords of all the world, as they give out; for we Castilians, who have measured it
with palmos, know with exactness the lands of China, where it will be well to know that the king of Espa&ntilde;a <a id="d0e4474"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4474">300</a>]</span>has continual wars with kings as powerful as their own [<i>i.e.,</i> the Chinese king], and subdues them and inflicts great troubles upon them. It is no new case, when our enemies imagine that
we are defeated, to find us desolating and destroying the confines of their lands, and not ceasing until we have hurled them
from their thrones and taken away their scepters. I would be very sorry for a change in trade, but I also believe that the
Chinese do not wish to lose it, since so great gain accrues from it, and the Chinese take to their kingdom so much of our
silver, which is never diminished in amount, in exchange for their merchandise, which is composed of poor articles that are
soon worn out.&#8221; The English ships that reached the coast of China, he was determined not to receive, for they are not Spaniards,
but their enemies, and are pirates. Consequently if they came to Manila they would be punished. &#8220;Finally, because we Spaniards
always justify our causes, and we pride ourselves on the fact that no one in the world can say that we usurp other men&#8217;s possessions
or make war on our friends, all that is herein promised will be fulfilled. And hereafter let those in China understand that
we never do anything through fear, or because of the threats of our enemies.&#8221; Don Pedro concludes by offering to continue
the friendship with the kingdoms of China by new bonds of peace, saying that he would release the prisoners in his galleys
in due time, although he first intended to make use of them, as he did, in the expedition of Maluco, which would soon be despatched.
All this he strictly observed.

</p>
<p>Don Pedro received other letters during those same days from the emperor of Japon, in which, after thanking him for a present
of grape wine&#8212;besides <a id="d0e4481"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4481">301</a>]</span>other rich presents&#8212;that Don Pedro had sent him, he earnestly requested commerce....

</p>
<p>[This letter, of which Argensola presents a mere synopsis, is given complete by Morga, <i>q.v. ante</i>.]

</p>
<p>In this same year, one thousand six hundred and four, the islands of Holanda and Zelanda, in pursuance of their custom, assembled
a fleet of twelve vessels, large and well equipped, and some smaller ones; and, as if masters of sea and wind, steered their
course toward India by the known routes. In a short time they reached the cape of Buena Esperan&ccedil;a. All the captains had gone
at other times on that voyage, and the pilots esteemed themselves of no less experience. Their general was Estevan Drage,<a id="d0e4490src" href="#d0e4490" class="noteref">27</a> faithless alike to his church and to his king....

</p>
<p>[Thence this fleet continues its course along Mosambique, India, and neighboring shores, Java, Sumatra, etc., taking prizes
and trading. In February, 1605, they capture Amboina, where they receive the submission of the Portuguese and allow religious
freedom. Finally part of the vessels go to the Moluccas, where, with the aid of the king of Ternate, the fort of Tidore is
captured&#8212;although the Portuguese are warned beforehand of their coming by English vessels (for the Spanish and English kings
were then friends), and the English leave powder and shot for its defense. Some Portuguese leave the island, &#8220;many going to
the Filipinas, where Governor Don Pedro interviewed them in order to learn the condition of affairs at Maluco.&#8221; The narrative
continues:]
<a id="d0e4498"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4498">302</a>]</span></p>
<p>One of those who escaped from the fort of Tydore, and reached the town of Arevalo in Filipinas, was Antonio de Silva, a Portuguese.
Besides being a soldier he was a <i>naguatato</i> or interpreter. This man gave a judicial account of the matter and added that the English [<i>i. e.</i>. Dutch] general, while taking him a prisoner from Amboino, took a sea-chart, and began to look for Mindoro, Manila, and Cabite.
Being asked by Silva, for what purpose he was looking for them, he learned that the general intended, in case hit undertaking
at Maluco did not succeed well, to try to capture one of the vessels plying between Filipinas and Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. Silva replied
to him that it was not time for those vessels to sail, either way; for the first [<i>i. e.</i>, those from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a], arrive about May ten, and the others [<i>i. e.</i>, those going to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a], sail June ten. Notwithstanding, this was the end or desire of the Dutchman&#8217;s navigation; for
he determined to get information in Mindoro, to depart thence to Mac&agrave;n, to send an ambassador to China, and to avenge the
insult offered by Don Pablos of Portugal in those provinces. Thence he would lade pepper in Patane, then see if he could defeat
the Chinese ships at the strait of Sincapura [<i>i.e.</i>, Singapore] on their way to Malaca; and at all events, continue along that same route his return to Holanda, laden with wealth.
All this did the Dutch general communicate to Antonio de Silva, as to one who would go to Holanda with him; for he was a soldier
and a skilled interpreter of both languages, and Estevan Drage made much of him for that reason. Certain others who had fought
and escaped the slaughter of Tydore confirmed this news. Don Pedro learned it, <a id="d0e4516"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4516">303</a>]</span>and grieved over it, as he was so zealous in the service of the Church and of his king. He considered sorrowfully when he
saw that not even one turret of a fortress was left in Maluco to the crown of Espa&ntilde;a, and how securely a rebel to God and
to his legitimate sovereign held them. And because the prosperity of Dutch affairs made the Dutch powerful and determined,
the governor assembled his council of war, and appointed Captains Antonio Freyle, chief of the fleet of Pintados, Pedro Sevil,
Estevan de Alca&ccedil;ar, and Bernardino Alfonso to go to the garrisons of the Pintados and those of other islands that were in
danger, with their infantry companies. He strengthened the ships, and prepared his artillery, as if he were near a victorious
enemy who was executing his threats with so great success. Antonio de Silva showed an original letter from another Dutch general,
written in the island of Borneo to the king of Ternate, sent by Philipo Bisseg&oacute;p, a ship captain. In it the general expressed
his compliments and sent him a present of a number of varas of different fine cloths from Holanda, six bales containing vessels
of musk, twelve flasks of rose water, six <i>arrates</i><a id="d0e4520src" href="#d0e4520" class="noteref">28</a> of <i>Amfi&oacute;n</i><a id="d0e4525src" href="#d0e4525" class="noteref">29</a>&#8212;a Dutch compound used, as above stated, for fighting, which takes away or disturbs the reason&#8212;and six barrels of powder.
He gave the king an account of the unfortunate voyage, and the obstacles, storms, and dangers that Andres Furtado had until
his arrival at Malaca after leaving Ternate. He called the king &#8220;most serene prince and powerful king of Maluco, Bandas, Amboino,&#8221;
and an infinite number of other islands. He congratulated him on the success attained <a id="d0e4530"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4530">304</a>]</span>upon his arrival at Maluco. He promised him to go to Ternate with the greater forces that he was awaiting from Holanda, and
garrison the forts, in order to extirpate entirely their common enemy, the king of Espa&ntilde;a. He encouraged him by this hope
to hold out until then. He assured him that he would overrun all those seas from Maluco, and would extend his empire to China,
without any opposition from the Filipinos or Japanese. For this purpose he requested the king [of Borneo] to renew friendship
with Mindanao, and to give the king of those islands to understand that he was a friend to the Dutch, and consequently to
facilitate the ports, commerce, and friendships that were necessary for their voyages. That was what was advisable above all
considerations of the state. He said that he should be warned and assured that nothing was attended to with more lukewarmness
in Espa&ntilde;a, than to strive or attempt to preserve the greater part of their provinces, or at least, any form of union. Therefore,
all the farthest colonies that recognized their crown, ought to esteem highly the delay with which they help and deliberate
from Espa&ntilde;a. For while they are believing, or examining in order to believe, the news of events, affairs are assuming another
condition; and hence neither Spanish counsels nor arms arrive in time. The greater part of these things had been taught to
his Highness by experience, and the writer&#8217;s desire to serve him obliged him to write those things to the king. Antonio de
Sylva added that he knew with certainty that the king of Ternate had not neglected to take any of the precautions that the
Dutchman asked him to take; and that he had even proposed to his men to go to fight far from their <a id="d0e4532"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4532">305</a>]</span>islands. Although it was never feared that they would be bold enough to do so, on that occasion Don Pedro was made more anxious
by this information, because the city had been left so weakened by the Sangley affair. He was trying, moreover, to supply
their lack, so that the late evils might not again happen; for it was so necessary to further by another road the trade of
Filipinas, and to provide for its domestic security, in order to be able to take the field.

</p>
<p>But time, which is wont both to take away and to give hopes, consoled Don Pedro in those afflictions, and brought him in a
few months from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a some ships of private persons, and afterward, in good season, the ships of the regular trading
fleet. They reached Manila on St. Matthew&#8217;s eve. In them were the Spaniards who left Espa&ntilde;a for that undertaking, together
with more than two hundred others whom the viceroy of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, the Marques de Montesclaros, sent to Don Pedro, together
with the other military stores and money, in accordance with the royal decree. Some of this came in charge of Brother Gaspar
Gomez, who was received with incredible joy. He presented to the governor all his despatches. Care was immediately taken to
lodge the captains and soldiers, and assign them quickly to their stations, so that all might believe that the only thing
intended with them was the safety of the Filipinas, which were threatened by the emperor of Japon and by the conspiracies
of the Sangleys. Corroboration of this report was sent in various directions that it might increase and be disseminated outside
the kingdom, in order not to give information to those whom the Spaniards had reason to fear. Besides, <a id="d0e4536"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4536">306</a>]</span>although the report of that great preparation was useful to the Spaniards in opinion and in conjectures, yet the actual strength
of the forces with which the country was supplied, besides the reputation of our affairs, acted for defense and security in
them all. In Japon the knowledge alone that Manila was full of infantry and of armed vessels tempered or dispelled the irritation
felt by their king because Don Pedro denied him shipbuilders. The Chincheos also refrained from attempting vengeance on an
enemy whose victories were followed by so great succor. Don Pedro considered the whole question, and inferred from every one
of these advices that he could absent himself from Manila. However the king of Ternate, as one overjoyed at having escaped
from the Spanish yoke, paid little heed to all that was told him from his neighboring kingdoms, for he thought that the Spaniards
were never to return to their former possessions. The captains of Holanda, who rebuilt the burned fortress in Tydore, sent
him some large bronze cannon, culverins, and a considerable number of muskets; and sent him some engineers from those who
came on those ships, so that they might inspect his fortifications and reside in them or in his city. Some accepted that abode,
and the loose and irreligious liberty of life permitted in that country. There, by reason of the many trading-posts and fleets
from the north, they lived as if they were not outside their own countries, since they had intercourse with their kinsmen
and friends, or at least with men of their nation. Exiled Castilians and Portuguese reached the port of Oton in Filipinas
daily. Among them was Pablo de Lima, a man of long experience, and <a id="d0e4538"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4538">307</a>]</span>now general of artillery in Tydore. He added to the news of the recent destruction, the joy with which the Dutch disinterred
the pieces that he had tried to hide, and how they had sent ashore more arms and forces from their ships. This man was received
with great honor because of his worth, and because he was one of those dispossessed, by the king of Ternate, of vassals and
other property in Tydore. For later events, they profited by his warnings and advice. All, by various employments, although
with equal desire, took part in the furtherance of the war&#8212;in building ships, and collecting provisions, arms, and ammunition.
So great was Don Pedro&#8217;s vigilance that he was not wanting in the least duty with example and encouragement. Consequently,
it may be asserted that he carried on the whole enterprise; for he lent a hand in the labors of all.

<h3>Conquest of the Malucas islands</h3>
<h3>Book Tenth</h3>
<p>In human actions the moral doctrine is hidden; and judicious writers are wont to deduce this from the relation of events,
as the fruit of their history. But in writing of the conquest and conservation of barbarous lands (which is founded on navigations
and garrisons), what civil precepts of those who establish and compose the political life&#8212;however sagacious statecraft may
have made them&#8212;can we bring to the reader&#8217;s view? And what can be offered in this matter that the reader could not infer as
a necessary consequence, contained in the preceding propositions? Since, then, the subject forbids us this role, let us finish
it, and redeem the promise by which we <a id="d0e4547"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4547">308</a>]</span>bound ourselves at the beginning. Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a, now general of the fleet which was assembled in Filipinas, attended
at the same time to its despatch and to the safety of the province, which he was about to abandon to go personally upon so
stubborn an undertaking. Some attribute the loss of all the Malucas to Don Pedro&#8217;s good fortune, so that, time offering him
greater material, the victory might be more glorious. He provided very diligently what was needed for the war and for almost
all the casualties thereof. The point or promontory of Yloilo extends into the sea not far from Arevalo in the island of Panay.
It is spacious enough to serve as a camping-place and suitable for those arms then prepared. There the fleet was assembled.
It consisted of five large ships, and six galleys; three galliots, like galizabras, belonging to the crown of Portugal&#8212;in
one of which Pedro Alvarez de Abreo, commandant of the fort of Tydore, embarked, while the other two were in charge of Juan
Rodriguez Camelo, a commandant sent from Malaca by General Andres Furtado de Mendo&ccedil;a, to aid with his prudence and his strength,
and to carry to him information of the outcome; one flat galliot for unloading artillery, which carried three hundred baskets
of rice; four vessels<a id="d0e4549src" href="#d0e4549" class="noteref">30</a> built for transporting the provisions; two ten-ton champans, carrying one thousand six hundred baskets of clean rice; two
English lanchas, in which the Portuguese went [to Manila] after the loss of the Tydore fort; seven fragatas belonging to his
Majesty, and seven belonging to individuals; and as many other champans&#8212;in all thirty-six sail. Master-of-camp Juan de <a id="d0e4561"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4561">309</a>]</span>Esquivel took twelve companies of Spanish infantry, of which four were levied in Andaluzia&#8212;namely, his own, that of Captain
Pablo Garrucho, that of Pedro Sevil, that of Lucas de Vergara Gaviria; and six in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, namely, that of Don Rodrigo
de Mendo&ccedil;a (this gentleman is the son of Don Juan de Bae&ccedil;a y Castilla and of Do&ntilde;a Maria de Mendo&ccedil;a, and on the latter side
grandson to the marques de Montesclaros; and left Italia to serve his Majesty in Filipinas, at the request of the viceroy
of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, his kinsman), the company of Captain Pascual de Alarcon Pacheco, that of Martin de Esquivel, that of Bernardino
Alfonso, that of Pedro Delgado, and that of Estevan de Alca&ccedil;ar. The other two, under Captains Juan Guerra de Cervantes and
Christoval de Villagr&acirc;, were from the camp of Manila and the province of Pintados. All of these with their officers amounted
to one thousand four hundred and twenty-three Spaniards. Under Master-of-camp Don Guillermo and Captains Don Francisco Palaot,
Don Juan Lit, Don Luys, and Don Agustin Lont were three hundred and forty-four Pampanga and Tag&aacute;l Indians; while there were
also six hundred and twenty men from the same tribes for the naval and military service, and six hundred and forty-nine rowers.
The entire fleet, exclusive of the household and following of the general, amounted to three thousand and ninety-five men;
they had seventy-five pieces of various kinds of artillery, and all the materials for navigating, disembarking, and fighting,
and for bombarding walls.

</p>
<p>Don Pedro left the port of Yloilo with this armament January five, one thousand six hundred and six, in doubtful weather,
but as courageous as ever. He <a id="d0e4565"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4565">310</a>]</span>reached the island of Mindanao, hostile to the Spanish name and allied with the Ternatans, and anchored in the port of La
Caldera to take in water. There the flagship, called &#8220;Jesus Maria,&#8221; in which Master-of-camp Esquivel was sailing, began to
drag the anchors with which it was moored&#8212;an action which the sailors name by the peculiar word <i>garrar</i><a id="d0e4569src" href="#d0e4569" class="noteref">31</a>&#8212;and, in order to save itself, had to set sail. But finding that it could not double a point in this way, it fired two shots
as a call for help, just when the rudder struck. The galleys hastened to give it a tow, but some cables were snapped atwain;
and their efforts were in vain, for the sea and winds prevented the work. Captain Villagr&agrave; was given charge of the rescue
of the men and provisions aboard the flagship. Although many possessions of the king and of private persons were lost, by
incredible effort he saved the bulk of the provisions and of the clothing, and all the men, artillery, powder, cables, rigging,
and sails. In order that the Mindanaos might not enjoy the spoils of the shipwreck, he set fire to the hull, after taking
out the nails and bolts. They felt this first misfortune because of its very importance, and because the soldiers, a class
often given to foolish superstitions, interpreted it in a sinister manner. The general&#8217;s prudence calmed everything. He ordered
the master-of-camp to proceed with the fleet from La Caldera to the port of Talangame, which, as we have said, is situated
in the island of Ternate. Don Pedro accompanied him <a id="d0e4581"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4581">311</a>]</span>with his galleys until they got outside the strait of Sambuanga, a place dangerous because of its currents and reefs. For
that reason they towed the ships, until this danger was past, and because of a calm that overtook them. The fleet took the
open sea. The galleys, in order to take in water enough to last until reaching Ternate, coasted along gradually; for the men
rescued from the submerged flagship were distributed in them and in the other boats, and their weight and peril was greater.
The most skilful pilots of those seas managed the galleys, but notwithstanding their care and that of the captains and experienced
sailors, they fell off their course and reached the islands of the Celebes or of Mateo, more than sixty leguas to the leeward
of Ternate. Contrary winds were blowing, and they had to correct their mistake by dint of rowing. In that manner, and with
great difficulty, they reached Ternate March twenty-six, on Easter day. With their observance of that day, so propitious to
all creation, they forgot their past dangers, and changed them into joy and hope.

</p>
<p>[Don Pedro finds the rest of his fleet at Tidore instead of at Ternate, as he has expected; but sees at the latter place a
Dutch ship, which shows fight. However, leaving the ship for the present, Acu&ntilde;a sets about the reduction of Ternate with his
own forces and those of the king of Tidore. Landing at Ternate April first, that fort is approached in two divisions, meeting
with no opposition until they arrive near the walls. Gallinato&#8217;s advice as to placing the soldiers is followed, and the Ternatan
scouts in trees are replaced by those of the besiegers. Active operations begin, and after various minor successes the wall
is carried by assault, and the old fortress <a id="d0e4585"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4585">312</a>]</span>built by the Portuguese is captured. On entering the city the soldiers fall to looting.]

</p>
<p>When the men entered the city, every one gave himself to his fury and to plundering. Don Pedro had issued a proclamation,
conceding that all the enemy captured within those four days should become slaves. The captains halted near the old church
of San Pablo, which had been fortified by the enemy for this war. There were various opinions as to what course was to be
followed. Some thought that they should attend to preserving what was gained; others that they should go ahead to gain the
chief fortress. Captains Vergara and Villagr&agrave; were of the latter opinion; and so great was the exuberance of the soldiers
and their desire for danger that one of them, a native of Estremadura, of the company of Captain Sevil&#8212;who was an Arragonese,
and a gallant fighter, who also approved the advice to pass on&#8212;seized Captain Villagr&agrave; in his arms, and carried him thus for
more than ten paces, exclaiming, &#8220;O good captain, attack the enemy, attack him!&#8221; and then set him down. Thereupon the captain
struck him with the flat of his sword, because he had at such a time seized him so impudently. The soldier bowed, and said
gracefully and smilingly, &#8220;Give me another, by God! [<i>cuerpo de Dios</i>] and attack them!&#8221; In fact Vergara and Villagr&agrave; attacked the principal fortress with few men and gained it, and were the
first to enter its gates. However they were not the first to go up, for while they were ascending very quickly by the stairs,
at the entrance of the hall an old soldier, named Barela, a corporal to Captain Cervantes, hurried past them. He, on entering,
took a gilded water-jar, shaped like an urn and very skilfully <a id="d0e4592"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4592">313</a>]</span>chased, from a rich side board and salver placed in the hall, saying to the captains, &#8220;Gentlemen, I take this in token that
I entered here with your Graces.&#8221; Accordingly he took it, with the consent of all. Then the entire palace was given over to
the pillage of the soldiers, and exposed to their greed. Don Pedro tried to restrain them, but was obeyed only near the end
of the sack.

</p>
<p>[The king of Ternate and a few of his kinsmen, together with the Dutch, escape, the former going to the island of Gilolo.
The reduction of the lesser forts continues, and some of the king&#8217;s relatives who are well affected to the Spanish, offer
to induce the king to surrender. This he does after a formal safe-conduct has been given by Acu&ntilde;a. Don Pedro receives him
in a manner befitting his rank, and houses him sumptuously, but at the same time keeps him carefully guarded. Several days
later a treaty is made with the king.]

</p>
<p>Two days after, the governor ordered Master-of-camp Gallinato and Captain Villagr&agrave;, together with Pablo de Lima, to confer
with the captive king concerning what agreement it was advisable to make with him in his Majesty&#8217;s name for the security and
solidity of matters. They were to persuade him that that was the way to attain merit and oblige our king to make better conditions
in his favor. The three came, accompanied by other influential persons, among whom were some Augustinian, Dominican, and Jesuit
religious, all of whom served in their ministry praiseworthily. The king did not refuse to capitulate. After some discussion
as to what form it should take, through the medium of Pablo de Lima, and after conceding to the king some things that he <a id="d0e4598"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4598">314</a>]</span>requested from the king, our sovereign, they wrote and signed the following agreements:

</p>
<p>The first thing demanded from King Cachil Sultan Zayde, of Ternate, and from the rest imprisoned with his Highness who may
have any part in it, is that he is to deliver to his Majesty King Filipo, our sovereign, the forts that he now possesses&#8212;namely,
those of Xilolo, Sabub&ugrave;, Gamocanora, Tacome, those of Maquien, those of Sula, and the others. He answers to this that he will
deliver to his Majesty the forts above declared, and that he will send the prince his son, and Cachil Amuxa, his cousin, with
the person or persons who shall go to take possession of them; and that they shall be delivered up with all the artillery,
ammunition, muskets, and arquebuses contained in them.

</p>
<p>The second. That he shall make restitution of all the captives that he holds, who may be our subjects, whether Christians
or infidels, from the provinces of Pintados and from the other provinces subject to the Spaniards in the Filipinas Islands.
He answered that all that are found at present shall be delivered up immediately, and that those who do not appear now shall
be delivered up as they shall be found later.

</p>
<p>The third. That he shall deliver up the Dutch in his power. He replied that when he left this fort of Ternate, thirteen or
fourteen Dutchmen with him took to flight, and he thought that they went to the Dutch vessel, for he has not seen them. However,
if they appear, he will deliver them up immediately.

</p>
<p>The fourth. He shall deliver up the Spanish renegades who were in this fort of Ternate. He answered that there was only one
there, and that he fled <a id="d0e4608"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4608">315</a>]</span>like the others the day the fort was taken, and he does not know where he is, but that he shall be sought and delivered up.

</p>
<p>The fifth. That he shall also deliver up all the villages in the island of Batochina or El Moro, which were formerly Christian;
as well as the islands of Marotay, and Herrao, which were also Christian, with all the artillery and ammunition in them. He
answered that he is ready to deliver up everything, as he did with his person.

</p>
<p>Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a, governor and captain-general of the Filipinas Islands, president of the royal Audiencia resident therein,
and general of this Maluco fleet, entrusted these capitulations to General Juan Xuarez Gallinato and captain Christoval de
Villagra. They made them in the form above declared, with the help of Pablo de Lima, a Portuguese native of these islands,
who was the interpreter of the [Moro] language. The said king affixed his signature, according to his custom. It was done
in the fort of Ternate April ten, one thousand six hundred and six. The said general and captain, and the said Pablo de Lima,
also signed it.

</p>
<p>The king signed it in Persian characters with graceful curves, and the Spaniards simply. This original agreement was brought
to Espa&ntilde;a with the other authentic documents.

</p>
<p>[Possession is formally taken of the newly-subdued and of the reconquered territory in the name of the king of Spain; and
after consultation it is determined to take the king of Ternate to Manila, leaving governors appointed to carry on his government.
All swear homage to the Spanish monarch, and promise not to admit the Dutch or other foreigners to their <a id="d0e4618"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4618">316</a>]</span>clove trade, and not to prevent missionary work. Acu&ntilde;a orders a new fort to be built at Tidore, remits a third part of the
tribute to be paid by the Ternatans, and, after strengthening the fort at Terate, leaves Juan de Esquivel there with six hundred
men, boats, ammunition, and supplies, to act as governor of all the Moluccas, while he returns to Manila with his prisoners.
Trouble begins immediately, and Esquival is kept busy with expeditions to the various islands and forts, while the Dutch again
begin their machinations; and sickness fights powerfully against the Spaniards. At Mindanao, a conspiracy to escape is discovered
among the prisoners, for Mindanao is friendly to the Ternatans. The narrative continues:]

</p>
<p>In all the time that we have described, no news of our victory reached Filipinas. From this silence and suspense they argued
in those regions, and especially in Manila, that Don Pedro and his fleet had perished, or that he had succeeded so poorly
that general sorrow would be caused. Never was virtue free from envious ones who pursue it, and such were not wanting to Don
Pedro in Manila. But although these were well known [<i>some words misprinted in text</i>]&#8212;so that popular suspicion makes them the authors of the poison from which it was believed that that great knight died, twenty-two
days after his arrival&#8212;we ahall suppress their names; since it is unworthy of the author, who has to maintain neutrality (and
indifference, in fact) to give strength to a rumor which even yet is based only upon a suspicion. All are now dead, and judged
before the tribunal where not one thought passes without examination. These men, then, spread the rumor that Don Pedro, having
assaulted <a id="d0e4625"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4625">317</a>]</span>Ternate, entered it easily; but that his men became so embarrassed in the midst of their great plundering that the barbarians,
having reflected, attacked the Spaniards and made them retreat, after killing the majority of them. They said that the general,
ashamed of his lack of discipline, did not dare return to Manila. When that report reached the Indians&#8217; ears, it did so great
harm that they began to rebel, especially in the provinces of Camarines and Pintados. The friars who were already attending
to their instruction could do nothing with them, for they asked, since the Malucans were victorious, why they should remain
subject to the Spaniards, who did not defend them from the Moros. They said that the latter would, with Ternate&#8217;s protection,
plunder them daily, and worse thenceforward. They did not stop at mere murmurs, for they began to confer concerning them,
and to talk of executing their plans. But all vanished before the truth and the news of it, which preceded the arrival of
the conquerors.....

</p>
<p>[The conquerors are given a triumphant reception, and the captives are cheered with hopes of an early release by a decree
from Spain, and lodged comfortably. The king of Ternate has a letter written to the Spanish monarch, in which he entreats
his clemency. Argensola ends with the reflection that &#8220;the Malucos being, then, reduced, our ministers and preachers went
thither, and the voice of the evangelist began to be heard in the remotest confines of the land.&#8221;]

<h2>Appendix: Customs of the Pampangas in Their Lawsuits</h2>
<p>[The following extract forms the second part of a treatise found in the body of <i>Ordinances enacted by the Audiencia of Manila</i>, given in <span class="smallcaps">Vols</span>. X and XI. The first part is entitled &#8220;Relation of the customs which the Indians were accustomed to observe in these islands;
written by Fray Joan de Pla&ccedil;en&ccedil;ia, and sent to Doctor Stiago de Vera, former president of the royal Audiencia which resided
in these islands.&#8221; This is signed with Plasencia&#8217;s name. The second part, headed as below, bears no signature, but is doubtless
by Plasencia. From their appearance in the body of the above document, it is probable that the Audiencia considered them in
assembly. Both these reports were written by Plasencia at the command of the governor or of the Audiencia, in order that the
local Spanish magistrates might be guided by the customs of the natives in deciding matters of law or justice among the Indians.
The first part, omitted here, is the same, with a few verbal changes, as the relation published in <span class="smallcaps">Vol</span>. VII. pp. 173&#8211;185; but it is dated, &#8220;Narcan, October twenty-four, one thousand five hundred and eighty-nine&#8221; (but this may
have been an error of the clerk of the Audiencia). The second part (<span class="smallcaps">Vol</span>. VII, pp. 185&#8211;196) is not found in the above Audiencia document.]

<h3>Instructions regarding the customs which the natives of Pampanga formerly observed in their lawsuits</h3>
<p>They never had anyone whom they all generally obeyed, except that only in each barangay they obeyed their chief, whose people
are called timaguas. Among the chiefs, lords of barangay, he who was most powerful tyrannized over the others, even though
they were brothers, because they were all intent upon their own interests.

</p>
<p>2. In what concerns regulation in regard to supplies for the country, they had none, and everyone bought and sold as he could;
beyond that each chief who ruled a barangay ordered his people to sow at the proper time, and made them assist him at seed-time
and harvest.

</p>
<p>3. The timaguas, or common people, came before their chief with their suits, and he settled them in this way. Whatever petition
was made before them, the chief summoned the party on whom the demand was made, and asked him if he would come to an agreement
with the other and opposite party. If the two parties made such agreement, there was no suit. If they would not agree, he
exacted an oath from them that they would submit to his judgment. Then he immediately asked for a <i>viva voce</i> examination of both, because among these people there were no writings any suits. If both parties gave like testimony, with
the same number of witnesses, they split the difference of the amount of the suit. If the number of witnesses was not equal
on either side, such and such a one was condemned to the whole amount, or released from the claim. If the defeated party would
not pay according to the sentence, the other party <a id="d0e4676"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4676">323</a>]</span>and the judge proceeded against him with the armed hand, and forced him to comply with it. The witnesses were paid according
to their rank, and the judge also. The payment of the judge and witnesses was so excessive, that they shared equally with
him who won in the suit. The witnesses of the condemned party were paid nothing; and if anything had been given to them before
the decision of the suit, it was taken back from them.

</p>
<p>4. <i>Item</i>: In regard to any murders that occurred, they ruled in this wise. If one chief killed another chief, the relatives and friends
of the murdered man went to war immediately with the murderer and his kindred; and if they killed the murderer, the quarrel
and difference between them was ended.  If not, they killed as many as possible of his followers. After these parties had
grown weary of their strife, and a certain time had elapsed after the murder, the other chiefs of the village or district
endeavored to reconcile them. The reconciliation was as follows. The murderer was to give and pay to the relatives of the
murdered man seventy or eighty taes of gold; and if he were a prominent chief, one hundred or more. Then they all remained
friends, and one half was divided among the children of the murdered man, if he had any, or his parents, brothers, or kindred;
and the other half among those chiefs who reconciled them, and the timaguas of the murdered man&#8217;s barangay, although the chiefs
took the greater part. If the children or relatives of the deceased refused to be reconciled, all the chiefs proceeded against
them, and assisted the party of the murderer until the said agreement was completed.

</p>
<p>5. In case any timagua killed any chief or his <a id="d0e4685"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4685">324</a>]</span>child, the relatives of the deceased put the murderer to death, together with his wife and children, if they succeeded in
catching him. They seized all his property, which they divided among the children of the murdered man, if he had any, and
if not, among his parents, relatives, or brothers; and if he had no kindred, among those who executed the vengeance for the
murder, this usually being his successor in the barangay.

</p>
<p>6. If the murdered man was a timagua, and the murderer a chief, the latter gave to the children or heirs of the murdered man
the sum of ten to twenty taes of gold; but if the murdered man had no heirs, it was divided between the judge passing sentence&#8212;who
was one of the chiefs, appointed by the others of the village for the purpose&#8212;and among the said chiefs, the judge taking
one half and the others the other half. Of this they gave no part to the murderer, even though he was a chief.

</p>
<p>7. <i>Item</i>: If one timagua killed another timagua, and had nothing with which to pay the penalty&#8212;ten to twenty taes of gold&#8212;all the
chiefs of the village killed him for it, if his own chief did not do this, by hanging him to a tree or <i>arigue</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, prop of a house] or piercing him with many lance-thrusts.

</p>
<p>8. If any woman killed any man, or another woman, by poison or steel or any other way, the judgment was in conformity with
the one above, with consideration for the said conditions.

</p>
<p>9. If a brother killed a brother or an uncle, or a nephew his uncle, he did not die for it; but they took all his property
away from him for the heirs of the murdered man, of which they gave no share to the murderer, even though he should be an
heir. <a id="d0e4704"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4704">325</a>]</span>This was determined by the chief of the barangay to which the murderer and the murdered belonged, if each party were of his
barangay. The chiefs of the barangay were judges, and shared with the heirs of the deceased.

</p>
<p>10. Concerning the murder of a child by a father, or a father by a child, no precise information could be secured regarding
the punishment, because all asserted that they never remembered such a murder to have happened.

</p>
<p>11. In case of the burning of any village or crops, if the incendiary was a chief, he paid for all the damage caused by the
fire&#8212;which the chiefs of such town and those nearest it determined&#8212;according to the amount of the damage, even though they
did not leave the chief who set the fire one mais of gold. If the damage did not exceed his property, and he had some property
left over, he retained it. If the incendiary were a timagua, he was executed, and his goods were seized to repair the damage.
If these did not suffice to pay for it, they sold his wife and children as slaves, to pay for the said damage.

</p>
<p>12. Concerning thieves: If the thief were a chief, he returned the plunder, and was fined in proportion to the theft, according
to the opinion of one of the chiefs of the village, whom the other chiefs selected as judge for that purpose. They say that
they ordinarily appointed the oldest and the most intelligent. The latter could moderate the penalty, which was divided between
the judge and the other chiefs, the judge taking one half.

</p>
<p>13. If a timagua or slave committed a theft: If the thief were a timagua, they compelled him to return his booty, and fined
him according to the regulations <a id="d0e4714"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4714">326</a>]</span>of the preceding section. If he had nothing with which to pay, they sold him in another village, in order to pay what he owed,
as a penalty for the theft. If the thief were a slave, his master paid for him, or delivered the said slave to the party,
and he was soundly lashed. If the owner of the said stolen goods caught the thief in the act of such robbery, he could kill
or beat him without any penalty.

</p>
<p>14. As for the old men, old women, and witches who committed murders by any of their practices, when it was ascertained that
they had killed any person with their witchcraft or tricks, the chief of their barangay, or of the barangay of the murdered
man, could kill them with daggers if he pleased; and if these chiefs did not do this, any of the other chiefs could kill the
criminals. Their property was seized, and one half was given to the relatives of the murdered man, and the other half to him
who executed the sentence upon such sorcerers and witches.

</p>
<p>15. Insulting words caused great anger among these natives, and it was considered a very grave offense, especially among the
chiefs. They fined the culprits in heavy sums therefor, inflicting this penalty in order not to cause murders, and in the
following manner. The insulted person and he who insulted him named a chief, who must be greater than those in the whole province,
to hear this suit, who accepted and decided it. If either of the two parties refused to conform to the agreement which the
judge prescribed, there was a custom among them that each one lavished expense, on his own account, on feasts and assemblies,
and he who spent the greater sum they considered the more powerful and honorable. From these debaucheries and gatherings sometimes
<a id="d0e4720"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4720">327</a>]</span>resulted wars between them. If either one of the two was the most considerable chief of the province, three or four, chosen
by the rest, judged the case. In case the injurious words were said by a timagua to a chief, if the said timagua had nothing
wherewith to pay the penalty imposed&#8212;which was very excessive&#8212;he was made a slave; and if the insulted party were a great
chief, the timagua&#8217;s wife and children were made slaves. If the chief applied insulting words to any timagua, the penalty
was very light, and many times nothing.

</p>
<p>16. Their marriage custom was to have one wife&#8212;from whom they would separate and marry another, on any occasion or change
of feeling&#8212;and to have three or four other women. They always considered that one the legitimate wife with whom they naturally
cohabited. The man always gave the dowry, and this, together with certain gatherings in which they drank, was considered marriage.
If the man separated from his wife, he lost the dowry which he had given her. If she separated from the man, she returned
double the dowry which she had received, even though she had children. The property acquired during marriage, they always
divided equally. They never disinherited the children in life or death, even though they were born of many women, if they
had been married to these.  The other children, born of other women, whom we call bastards, they called <i>asiao yndepat</i>. These did not inherit, but they always gave them something. Even if any one had no legitimate child at his death, the bastard
could not inherit at all, but the property went to the nearest relatives of the deceased.

</p>
<p>17. They were not accustomed to will more to <a id="d0e4729"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4729">328</a>]</span>any child, except in small sums, as three or four taes, or small pieces of land of the like value.

</p>
<p>18. When anyone became a widower and no children had been born to the husband and wife, the whole dowry was returned.  But
if any sons or daughters had been born to them, even though these were dead at the time of bereavement, not more than half
the dowry was returned.

</p>
<p>19. If any child were living at the time of the death of the father or mother, all the property of the deceased was inherited
by the child or children. If they were not old enough to administer it, the parents of the deceased kept and used it, and
not the surviving father or mother of the minors.  If the minor died afterward, neither the father nor the mother inherited
it, but the minor&#8217;s grandparents, or the nearest relatives of the deceased from whom the minor had inherited the property.

</p>
<p>20. Among the slaves, the father and mother shared equally. If both were slaves of one master, the children were so also.
If one slave belonged to one master and the other to another, the children were divided in this way. The master of the father
took the eldest, the master of the mother, the second; and so on in this order with the rest. If there were an odd one, the
two masters of the parents divided him; that is, the slave served both masters equally. If either the father or mother were
free, the children were divided in the same way, so that if the father was free, the eldest son or daughter was free. On the
contrary, if the father was a slave, the eldest son or daughter was a slave. This arrangement was kept and observed among
them, namely, to give an equal share to both the father and mother. If one of them <a id="d0e4737"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4737">329</a>]</span>was free or half-free, they gave his part to him and to his children in proportion to the amount which fell to his lot.

</p>
<p>21. If any chiefs wrangled over their cultivated lands, they came before the other chiefs of the village; and these tried
them, and received testimony orally from both sides, under oath, according to their usage&#8212;which was sweating by the crocodile,
the sun, the moon, and many other things by which they swore. In conformity with the evidence of each one, the suit between
the said chiefs was decided; and if either one of them refused to comply with the sentence, all the chiefs together compelled
him to observe it. This order was adhered to in this matter.

</p>
<p>22. All the aforesaid information I have endeavored to procure from the oldest inhabitants of this province, and from all
the priors of the province. If it be not set forth in a style as good as I ought to use, I beg your Lordship to pardon its
defects, for the sake of my good will, etc.
