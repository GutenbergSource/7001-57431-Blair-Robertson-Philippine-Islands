<h2 class="normal">Preface</h2>

<p>The main part of this volume is a record of the Recollect missions
in the Philippines from 1661 to 1712; these are conducted mainly in
western Luz&oacute;n, Mindanao, and Calamianes, and Assis&rsquo;s
account contains much information of interest regarding conditions in
those regions. &ldquo;Moro raids in the seventeenth century&rdquo;
summarizes the principal events connected with that topic; and the
Jesuit Clain presents an interesting account of the discovery that the
islands called Palaos exist within range of the Philippines.</p>

<p>Extracts from letters written by Manila Jesuits in 1691 and 1694
furnish some items of news. Governor Cruzat y Gongora is making
rigorous exactions upon the alcaldes-mayor and the tributary Indians;
he engages in trade, and accepts gifts from office-seekers. In 1692,
two richly-laden vessels from Manila are lost; and in 1694 another,
which contained all the available wealth of the Manila citizens.
Various ecclesiastical squabbles continue as echoes of the Pardo
controversy.</p>

<p>A letter from the Jesuit Paul Clain (June 10, 1697) gives a vivid
description of the arrival in Samar of some strange people, driven from
their homes in the Palaos (or Pelew) Islands; and reports <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>the information
gained from them about that hitherto unknown group in the broad
Pacific. These foreigners receive kind treatment from the natives of
Samar, and religious instruction from the missionaries there; and they
desire to open communication between their own islands and the
Philippines.</p>

<p>The chief part of this volume is devoted to the Recollect missions
in various portions of the Philippines, the period treated in general
being included in the years 1661&ndash;1712, although some few remarks
touch a later period. The main portion of the account is taken from the
chronicle of Pedro de San Francisco de Assis, the author of the fourth
part of the Recollect <i lang="es">Historia general</i>; the second and
subsidiary part from vols. viii and ix of Juan de la
Concepci&oacute;n&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Historia</i>, this portion being
designed merely to supplement the preceding account.</p>

<p>San Pedro de Assis describes cursorily the insurrection in Pampanga
(there scarcely more than an attempt) and the more serious uprising in
the province of Pangasinan and Zambales, and the part played by the
Recollects in restoring peace. The revolt in Pampanga arises, like so
many minor revolts in the past, through the injustice of lesser
officials&mdash;this time the superintendent of the timber-cutting.
Under leadership of one Francisco Manyago, a native military official,
the Pampangos attempt to gain freedom, and plan a general uprising
among various provinces. But though the most warlike of the Filipinos,
they are at the same time the most reasonable, and are, consequently,
easily quieted by the personal efforts of the governor, assisted ably
by the various religious orders. More difficult to eliminate, however,
is the leaven of discontent injected by the <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb11" href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>Pampangos into the other provinces
of Ilocos and Pangasinan. These northern provinces begin to think of a
union for the purpose of securing liberty, and of a central government
of their own. Our author chooses as his field more particularly the
story of the revolt in Zambales, which he calls a district of the
province of Pangasinan, and which is a Recollect mission territory. The
revolt of Pangasinan is under the leadership of Andr&eacute;s
M&aacute;long, who aspires to kingship and who gradually gathers an
army, some say, of 40,000 men. He intrigues through certain relatives
and adherents in Zambales to compel the Zambals to declare in his
favor, but notwithstanding the many in sympathy with him there, his
attempts are bootless, for the Recollect religious work so strongly and
courageously against his machinations that, in the end, entirely
conquered by the troops sent against him from Manila, he meets the fate
of other insurgent leaders. The efforts of M&aacute;long, through his
relative Sum&uacute;lay, in the village of Bolin&aacute;o, are
frustrated by the vigilance and courage of Juan de la Madre de Dios,
the vicar in charge of the convent there, but his church is burned by
the insurgent sympathizers. The fathers and loyal natives,
notwithstanding repeated threats of death, under the active leadership
of the above father hold to their post, although one of the fathers,
Luis de San Joseph, would have gladly abandoned the place. This same
priest, however, performs brave feats in his delivery of messages from
the vicar of Lingay&eacute;n (who describes the revolt in Pangasinan,
and asks aid from Manila), to the convent of Masinloc. Thence those
messages are taken to Manila by Bernardino de la Concepci&oacute;n,
accompanied by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href=
"#pb12">12</a>]</span>three loyal chiefs, who are suitably rewarded for
their services.</p>

<p>With the absence from Masinloc of the three loyal chiefs
above-mentioned, treason shows its head in that village, its immediate
outbreak being due to an inopportune rebuke administered by the prior
to a chief who had neglected to attend mass. The religious and loyal
natives are besieged in the convent, but escape by stratagem, by
seizing a boat in which some natives have come to the village. Reaching
the village of Bag&aacute;c, they meet there the three loyal chiefs who
are returning from Manila, and with their aid and that of thirty men
gathered by the prior of Bag&aacute;c, they recover the village of
Masinloc from the insurgents. The majority of the inhabitants receive
pardon, but three of the ringleaders are put to death.</p>

<p>In the village of Cigay&eacute;n, a chief, Sirray, acts as agent for
M&aacute;long, but failing to succeed in his plan to murder the
religious there, finally joins M&aacute;long with twenty-five
followers, while the father retires to Manila, and the village is
abandoned by its other inhabitants. The village of Agno is quieted by
the efforts of the Recollect Luis de San Joseph; and the chief, Durrey,
the cause of the trouble there, and twelve of his partisans are forced
to flee. In Bolinao, the flames of insurrection break out once more,
for the vicar, Juan de la Madre de Dios, is now alone. M&aacute;long
sends an emissary, one Cauc&aacute;o, to deliver to him a letter,
demanding that the place be turned over to him. The father, however, is
enabled by the chance arrival of a champan with some religious,
Spaniards, and natives, who are fleeing from Ilocos, to outwit his
enemies for the time being. The quiet <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb13" href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>of Bolinao lasts only so long as the
above-mentioned champan remains there. After its departure
M&aacute;long tries to secure the murder of the religious through
Durrey and Sum&uacute;lay. The former is dissuaded from the attempt,
and the latter persisting, is in turn attacked by the father, and
wounded, although he escapes by the connivance of some of the
inhabitants of Bolin&aacute;o.</p>

<p>Meanwhile definite arrangements are made in Manila&mdash;and that
more speedily than is the custom there&mdash;for sending troops to put
down the incipient rebellion. The aid consists of a fleet under Felipe
de Ugalde, and an army of 200 Spaniards, and 400 natives, under
Francisco de Esteb&aacute;r. These joining and assisted further by some
Zambals, quickly break up organized hostility. Punishment (too severe
some think, but our author justifies it) is meted out to the leaders:
M&aacute;long is shot; Sum&uacute;lay, Cauc&aacute;o, Sirrey, and
Durrey are hanged; while another leader in order to escape the
death-sentence kills himself. Thus the insurrection, which has lasted
but a portion of the years 1660 and 1661, comes to an end, and this
attempt, perhaps the earliest in which various tribes or peoples of the
Filipinos (although but waveringly it is true) show any desire to act
in concert, is recorded only as a failure. The Sangleys, who have
openly encouraged the insurrection, and have even fought in their
ranks, also attempt to revolt, partly in response to the efforts of the
pirate Kuesing; but their plans, both in 1661 and 1662, come to naught,
divine Providence each time allowing the Recollects to act as agents.
But the second attempt is put down only after the shedding of much
Sangley blood.</p>

<p>Probably in the year 1662, the first work of the Recollect <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>on the coast
of Luzon opposite Manila begins, with the invitation of the Franciscans
who are engaged in work there, but who must give up that field, a poor
one, because of a scarcity of religious. Quickly accepting the
invitation, the Recollects enter upon the work with enthusiasm, and
found the convents of Binang&oacute;nan, Val&eacute;r,
Casig&uacute;ran, and Pal&aacute;nan. In that district much fruit for
heaven is gathered; but in 1704 the dearth of religious (for none pass
from Spain to the Philippines from 1692 to 1710) causes the order to
restore the district to the Franciscans. Continuing, the deaths of the
missionaries Juan de San Antonio and Joseph de la Anunciation in the
years 1663 and 1664 are recorded, and synopses of their lives
given.</p>

<p>In chapter viii, Assis, going back somewhat, gives a
r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the sufferings of the Recollects between the
years 1640&ndash;1668. These sufferings and persecutions come mainly
from the Moros, who by their continual raids make themselves the
scourge of all the Philippine mission villages; and such is the
boldness of those pirates that they do not even hesitate to carry on
their operations in sight of Manila itself. Added to the terrors of the
Moros is also the active injury inflicted by the Dutch, those heretics
allying themselves even with the Moros to cause injury to the true
Catholic faith. The peace between Spain and Holland comes as a most
welcome relief to the colony. The Recollect villages and missions being
in the very midst of the Moro territory are the worst afflicted by that
scourge. Their pitiful petitions for aid fall on deaf ears, for at
Manila, self interest rules, and trade is the syren of the hour, not
religion. The Recollects, too, are not without their <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>martyrs for the
faith as the result of Moro persecutions, while others succumb to the
hardships of the missionary labors.</p>

<p>The work among the Zambals is again taken up by our author in the
year 1670. The inhabitants of that district are a fierce people, those
in the mountains being more so than those dwelling along the coast and
on the plains, where they have had intercourse with other natives and
with Spaniards. The mountain population contains many apostates and
heathens, while many Negritos wander homeless and in utter barbarous
condition through their fastnesses. Although all those people are
hostile among themselves, they unite against the Spaniards, for their
common hatred to the latter draws them together. All the orders have
had a share in the reduction of those fierce people, but the Recollects
with the greatest success. The fierceness of the people leads the
Recollects to employ gentle means, and thus by adapting themselves to
the genius of their flock they gain many converts&mdash;the most
abundant being during the years 1668&ndash;1671, when the provincial
Cristobal de Santa Monica appoints nine religious for the work. As a
result of their labors 2,000 people are reduced to a Christian and
settled life, and others also adopt the faith. The new villages of Iba
(formerly called Paynav&eacute;n), Subic, and M&oacute;rong are formed
from the converts, while all the old villages increase in population.
Two new convents are established&mdash;one in Paynav&eacute;n, and the
other in Bag&aacute;c. All this is accomplished by the year 1670. In
1671, Joseph de la Trinidad makes great gains for Christianity in the
Zambal district, and, on becoming provincial in 1674, takes especial
care of those missions. But unfortunately <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb16" href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>the Recollects clash with the
Dominicans, whose administration lies in the district of Bat&aacute;an;
and although the Recollects resist, they are at length (1679) compelled
by the archbishop, Felipe de Pardo (who covets the entire district for
his order) and the governor to cede the Zambal missions to the
Dominicans, and to take in exchange the island of Mindoro, which has
been for many years in charge of the seculars.</p>

<p>Following is told in synopsis the life of Miguel de Santo
Tom&aacute;s, most of whose mission life has been spent in the province
of Caraga. The general chapter of 1672, meeting in Spain, assigns
definitors and discreets to the Philippine province.</p>

<p>Chapter iv of the ninth decade of the history carries us into
Mindanao, where the work among the heathen <span class="corr" id=
"xd0e242" title="Source: Tagabal&oacute;yes">Tagabal&ograve;yes</span>
is reviewed. These are a heathen people living in the neighborhood of
Bislig in Caraga, the Recollect mission center farthest from Manila, in
the mountains called Balooy (whence their name). They are a
domestically inclined people, courageous and intelligent, faithful in
their treaties and promises, and said to be the descendants of the
Japanese. Not much can be done among them until the year 1671 because
of the Moro wars, the little government aid received, and the scarcity
of religious, the two in the district being unable to extend their
labors much outside of their regular duties. But in 1671, Juan de San
Felipe, the new provincial, who has been a missionary in Bislig,
appoints a religious especially to look after the conversion of the
mountain people. That religious aided by the other two, has baptized
300 adults by 1673, besides 100 others who die immediately after
receiving that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href=
"#pb17">17</a>]</span>sacrament. By 1674 the district of Bislig has
increased from 200 to 800 whole tributes. This conversion has been
aided by certain miraculous occurrences.</p>

<p>In 1674, Joseph de la Trinidad the provincial increases the mission
forces by the appointment of special ministers who visit the various
districts continually, carrying aid to the most needed parts of the
districts assigned them, and thus easing the burden of the missionaries
already established in the various villages by giving them more time to
attend to their regular duties. His greatest efforts he expends in the
Mindanao provinces of Butuan and Cagayan, where Christianity, in
consequence, makes vast gains. The faith is carried among the Manobos
of the Linao district, and the population of the villages increases.
The three religious working in the mountains of Cagayan, and in toward
Lake Malanao, reduce more than one hundred tributes to Christian
villages in spite of the hostility of the Moros, the conversion being
aided throughout by manifest miracles.</p>

<p>The ninth chapter of the ninth decade relates the work in the new
field of Mindoro. The mission work of that island (of which and its
people a brief description is given) is first begun by the
Augustinians, who cede the district to the Franciscans. Later the
Jesuits maintain a number of missionaries there and found the permanent
mission of Naojan, which is maintained until Luis de San Vitores goes
to the missions of the Ladrones or Marianas, when the island is turned
over to three seculars. The district is a poor one, and the seculars,
although zealous in their duties, cannot be adequately supported.
Finally in 1679, as related above, the Recollects, after their <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>glorious
record in the Philippines and their flourishing mission work in the
Zambal district, take up the Mindoro mission field, after a vain
protest at being ousted from their Zambal missions. The transfer is
speedily concluded by chaplaincies being provided for the seculars, and
the Recollects, taking possession of the new territory, immediately put
six religious to work. The new leaver is felt instantly and the number
of Christians increases from 4,000 in 1679 to 8,000 in 1692, and to
12,000 in 1716. Although the Moro depredations lessen that number
later, in 1738, San Antonio still chronicles over 7,000. The first
convent established at Baco is later moved to Calapan. Convents are
also established at Naojan, Calavite, and Mang&aacute;rin (which is
later removed to Bongabong, because of its unhealthy site and the raids
of the Moros), all of which have their visitas. A mountain mission
established later results in a great increase to the Christians of
Mindoro.</p>

<p>The succeeding chapter deals with the resumption of the Recollect
missions in Calamianes which have been abandoned in 1662 because of the
Chinese pirate Kuesing, and the consequent withdrawal of the support of
the military. All but two of the missions, those in Cuyo and Agutaya,
which are retained by the Recollects, have been given into the care of
one secular priest, and this arrangement is maintained until 1680, when
the Recollects (although somewhat unwillingly on their part) again
accept the ministry of those islands. In November of 1680 three
religious are sent there, the possession of the Recollects is given
royal confirmation in 1682, and in 1684 the arrival of a new mission
allows them to assign other workers to the field. There are plenty of
hardships <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href=
"#pb19">19</a>]</span>to suffer, but the fruit is great. New missions
are established, and by 1715 the number of Christians has risen from
4,500 in 1680 to 18,600; and in 1735 Calamianes and Rombl&oacute;n
contain 21,076 Christians. Certain missionaries are named and praised
for their work. Incidentally an interesting description is given of the
training of the native children for the service of the Church, by which
our author refutes the charge that the religious have many
servants.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their efforts, several times all but successful, the
Recollects are unable to extend their evangelization to the great
empire of China, as is related in chapter ii of decade x. The
succeeding chapter tells of the Recollect missions sent from Spain to
the Philippines during the three decades covered by this history
(1661&ndash;1690). The first leaves Spain in 1660 under the leadership
of Eugenio de los Santos, and consists of twenty choristers and two
lay-brothers. One of the entire number reaches Manila in 1662, and
fourteen others the following year. The second mission is in charge of
Christobal de Santa Monica, who has been appointed procurator in 1663.
All of that mission of twenty-four religious which sets sail in 1666
reaches Manila in 1667, except two who remain in Mexico. The third
mission is collected in 1675 by Juan de la Madre de Dios, who takes the
twenty-six religious composing it to Mexico, but there hands them over
to another religious while he himself returns to Spain. They reach the
islands in 1676. In 1680, Cristobal de Santa Monica is sent to Spain as
procurator, reaching his destination in 1681. In 1683, he sails from
Cadiz with a mission consisting of nineteen fathers, nineteen
choristers, and five lay-brothers. All of that number, except <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>one who dies
at sea and two who desert at Puerto Rico and return home, reach the
Philippines in April, 1684, and are distributed among the convents. The
general chapter of 1684 held in Spain elects definitors and discreets
for the Philippine province.</p>

<p>Most of chapter v of decade x treats of the life of Juan de la Madre
de Dios, which we give by synopsis and extract. He is one of the most
active and able workers whom the order has had in the islands, where he
has held many offices in the order and has also worked valiantly in the
missions. He is one of the most untiring of idol-worship destroyers,
and even dares to venture alone to the places where heathen assemblies
are held for the purpose of their nefarious worship. Of a political
nature also, so far as the order is concerned, his work is by no means
slight, and he obtains much for his province in Spain. His death occurs
in the latter country in 1685. This same chapter relates also the life
of Thom&aacute;s de San Geronimo (given by us in synopsis), a
missionary in the Visayan region. He is elected provincial in 1680, and
so well is he liked that he is again elected in 1686 against his will.
His death occurs the same year.</p>

<p>In chapter viii of decade x the Recollect labors in the islands of
Masbate, Ticao, and Burias are reviewed. These islands which have been
conquered during the early years of Legazpi&rsquo;s arrival in the
archipelago are an important way-station for ships plying between Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a and the islands. The faith is introduced into Masbate by
the Augustinians under Alonso Jimenez, who is called the &ldquo;apostle
of Masbate.&rdquo; The Augustinians, however, abandon <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>that island and
Ticao in 1609, and seculars have charge of the mission work there from
that year until 1688. In the latter year the Recollects are substituted
for the seculars in accordance with the plan of the bishop of Nueva
C&aacute;ceres, that the district be given to a regular order. A decree
of August 13, 1685 grants the islands to the Recollects as well as
certain villages in Luz&oacute;n. The latter are resigned by that order
to the Franciscans, as they can be administered more easily by them,
but the islands of Masbate, Ticao, and Burias are accepted by them in
1687. In 1688 the cession is made by the secular in charge at
Mob&oacute; in the island of Masbate, to the content of the natives who
welcome the Recollects. A good convent is founded in Mob&oacute; and
three new villages, in addition to the six existing when the Recollects
enter, are established. In 1726 another convent is founded in the
district after the wreck of a galleon in order that the image of the
Santo Cristo of Burgos which is carried by that ship and which is saved
through the diligence of one of the passengers on the vessel, Julian de
Velasco, may be properly housed. In reply to a petition of the
Recollects in 1724 asking royal confirmation of the Masbate missions, a
report on their work there is ordered. It is found that the number of
families has increased from 187 in 1687 to 585 in 1722, an increase of
398 families or 1,592 persons. In 1738, there are 5,000 persons in the
islands, and three new villages, one in Ticao, and two in Masbate. This
means that the order has formed six villages and brought 3,252 persons
to the bosom of the Church in the time that they have had control of
this district. The number has been lessened by the invasions of the
Moros. The conversions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href=
"#pb22">22</a>]</span>have been made among heathens, apostates,
refugees from other islands&mdash;all of whom represent the worst
elements. The Recollects have had to fight against the forces of
nature, the Moros, and sorcery. They have persevered in the face of all
manner of hardships&mdash;hardships that cause some of the missionaries
who have been there to say that the Masbate territory offers more
suffering than any other mission field.</p>

<p>The extracts from Concepci&oacute;n cover in part the same field as
the history by San Francisco de Assis; except the third, which tells of
the restoration of the missions of Zambales to the Recollects, and
gives a brief account of the judicial proceedings between that order
and the Dominicans.</p>

<p>The first extract concerns the enforced transfer of the Zambal
missions to the Dominicans. This comes about directly from the
representation made in the Council of the Indias by Diego de Villaroto,
to the effect that the conversion of the island of Mindoro would
progress much more rapidly if given to the religious order best suited
therefor, and if the seculars in charge of the curacies there be
appointed to chaplaincies. Royal attention is given this petition and
in 1677 a royal decree orders the governor and archbishop to make the
transfer. In consequence, Felipe Pardo, the archbishop, quick to seize
the opportunity, aided by the governor, compels the unwilling
Recollects to give up their missions among the Zambals and take the
island of Mindoro, in order that the Dominicans might take the former.
Such an arrangement is very convenient for the Dominicans, as it
enables them to better concentrate their missions in Pangasinan, and
affords them easier communication <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23"
href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>among their various missions. The protests
of the Recollects that the Zambals prefer their order and that the
people of Mindoro will prefer their old missionaries the Jesuits, and
that the two districts will be disturbed and restless has no weight,
and the governor sees that they are kept quiet through the Spanish
officials there. The three Recollects assigned to Mindoro are Diego de
la Madre de Dios, Diego de la Resurrection, and Eugenio de los Santos,
and they are each given one assistant. A description of Mindoro and its
people follows, and a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of its early conquest and of
missionary labors there. Since the Jesuits have abandoned that field
(with the going of Luis San V&iacute;tores to the Marianas) the
seculars have had ecclesiastical charge of the island, but it is a poor
place and scarcely can any secular be found who cares to accept it.
After the entrance of the Recollects, the number of Christians steadily
rises, evangelization making progress among the Mangyans, Negritos, and
other peoples. Four convents are established, each of them with several
visitas, and the mission to the Mangyans on the bay of Ilog, in the
last of which none of the apostatized Christians are allowed to enter
lest they pervert the new plants. &ldquo;But that fine flower-garden
[<i>i.e.</i>, the island of Mindoro] has been trampled down and even
ruined by the Moros.&rdquo; The Dominicans bend their energies to the
work in their newly-acquired missions of Zambales. With malicious
satisfaction, Concepci&oacute;n reports that their efforts have
resulted mainly in failure. Believing that the eleven villages which
they have received from the Recollects are too many for the best
administration of the district, they endeavor to consolidate and move
some of them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href=
"#pb24">24</a>]</span>Bolinao, which under the Recollect regime was
located on a small island off the coast of Zambales, is moved across
the channel to the barren coast where &ldquo;many inconveniences but no
advantages&rdquo; are possessed. Agno is moved inland from the coast;
Sigayen is also moved, the only advantage made by the changed site
being the river of fresh water on which it is located. Paynav&eacute;n
is moved inland to the site of Iba, to which its name is changed, and
Iba becomes the capital of the district, but in order that it may
become so, some families are moved from Bolinao. The villages of
Cabang&aacute;n and Subic are made from the consolidation of several
others, and the places left vacant by refugees are tilled by families
from Pangasinan, whence the natives can be moved easier as that
province is so densely populated that there is not sufficient room for
all of them. The inference is that the evil caused by the
administration of the Dominicans is greater than the good, in
discontent among the Zambals and the flight of many families to Ilocos
and to the mountains.</p>

<p>The second extract recounts, quite similarly to the version given by
San Francisco de Assis, the work in Recollect missions in the islands
of Masbate, Ticao, and Burias. These islands are a part of the
bishopric of Nueva C&aacute;ceres, and are under the civil control of
the alcalde of Albay. Masbate, the largest, has traces of gold and some
fine copper mines, but the gold has never paid well. All three islands
possess excellent timber and many civet-cats. The early history of the
islands and their early spiritual conquests are told. Through the
efforts of the bishop, Andres Gonzales, O. P., the islands are given to
the Recollects, the secular priest in charge there being given <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>a chaplaincy
instead. Certain villages of Luz&oacute;n, which were also to be given
to the Recollects, are given instead to the Franciscans who contest
them with the former. The islands are important both from a secular and
religious point of view, for they are a way-station for the Acapulco
ships, and also for the Recollect missions in Ceb&uacute; and Mindanao.
As related above, the Recollects ask royal confirmation of the missions
of these islands in 1724, and the subsequent report rendered shows that
their work has resulted in great progress, and that they have made the
islands a safe place where before they were most dangerous both on the
coast and in the interior.</p>

<p>The third extract concerns the work of the Dominicans in the
missions of Zambales and the restoration of that district to the
Recollects. From Concepci&oacute;n&rsquo;s account (which must be read
in connection with that by Salazar, the Dominican), the Dominican order
did not have the success of their predecessors among the fierce
Zambals, and ended rather in alienating them by their aggressive
treatment; while the Recollects have, on the contrary, employed gentle
means by which they have won the hearts and minds of the Zambals. The
presidio at Paynav&eacute;n which has been increased, is injudiciously
allowed to make raids among the natives upon any occasion. The trouble
comes to a head with the murder of the nephew of one of the chiefs,
Dalinen, by another chief Calignao, the latter of whom appears to have
been a thoroughly unreliable and malicious man. Dalinen, in order to
avenge the murder in accordance with Zambal traditions, takes to the
wilds, but with his followers, is pursued by the soldiers of the
garrison. As Calignao has not fled, the missionary Domingo
P&eacute;rez, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href=
"#pb26">26</a>]</span>O.P., in order to win him over, indiscreetly
announces that the murder of Dalinen&rsquo;s nephew has been by command
of the government, which has ordered that all those who refuse to
reduce themselves to village life be killed. Calignao, as another act
in the tragedy, plans to kill Dalinen, and by the aid of a Negrito,
accomplishes that design. Then, in order to show in full light his
character, he compasses the death of Domingo P&eacute;rez, wounding the
latter so severely that he dies through lack of efficient care.
Although the Dominicans claim certain miraculous occurrences as
happening at the death of the above father, Concepci&oacute;n disproves
them all. The remainder of the extract has to do with the suits between
the Recollects and the Dominicans in regard to the Zambal missions,
which last spasmodically from the time the Recollects are compelled to
abandon them until the time of their restoration in 1712. The
Recollects claim throughout that they have been despoiled unjustly of
the missions, and that although they accepted the missions of Mindoro,
they have had no other alternative, and have not accepted them as a
compensation for the loss of the Zambal missions. Indeed they have
never renounced their claim to those missions, but have regularly
appointed ministers for them (who of course have not labored in those
missions). The Dominicans, on the other hand assert that they have
merely taken over those missions in response to commands from the
archbishop and the governor to that effect. The suit drags on wearily,
each side asserting its rights, and the matter being delayed by such
proceeding until it seems unending. Finally the Dominicans, with a
change of procurator, shift their tactics, and allege that they are not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>at all a
parry to any suit, and since they have received the missions at the
order of the governor, they are ready to resign them if requested so to
do. The Recollects maintain the opposite, namely, that the Dominicans
are a party to the suit; and the verdict is at length given to them,
and the Dominicans are ordered in 1690 to appear before the Audiencia
within three days to plead their right. The summons is neglected until
the year 1710, when the attorney for the Recollects again stirs up the
matter, and notwithstanding the fact that the Dominicans still adhere
to their former statements that they are not a party to the suit, the
matter is brought to court, and the missions of the Zambals turned over
to the Recollects by special sentence.</p>

<p>Through nearly all of the Spanish regime in the Philippines, those
islands, especially and most the Visayan, suffered greatly from the
frequent and cruel raids of the Moro pirates from Mindanao and other
islands south of it. Some account of these is a necessary part of this
work; but our limits of space will not allow us to reproduce verbose
and detailed relations like that of Comb&eacute;s (in his <i lang="es">
Hist. de Mindanao</i>), especially as this and some others of similar
tenor cover but a short period of time. In an appendix to this volume
we present a brief summary of this subject, down to the end of the
seventeenth century; the first part is an outline merely, drawn from
our previous volumes, giving full citations therefrom, which show the
relations existing between the Spaniards and the Mahometan Malays from
1565 to 1640. The second part covers the same subject for the rest of
the century; it is composed of the accounts given by Murillo Velarde,
Diaz, and other historians, arranged <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb28" href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>in chronological
order&mdash;sometimes synopsized, sometimes translated in full,
according to the prolixity or the relative importance of each. From the
beginning were evident various elements of hostility&mdash;racial,
religious, and commercial&mdash;between the Spaniards and the Moros,
which were soon aggravated by the Spanish desire for conquest and the
Moro greed for plunder and bloodshed. The unfortunate natives of the
northern islands who had been subjugated by the Spaniards were unable
to defend themselves from their enemies, and the Spanish power was
often inadequate to protect them or to punish the invaders. The pirates
were intimidated and curbed for a long time by Corcuera&rsquo;s
brilliant campaigns in Mindanao and Jol&oacute; (1637&ndash;38); and
other punitive expeditions had a like though often temporary effect in
later years. In the latter part of the century peace prevailed between
these enemies for a long time, probably because no one of the Moro
chiefs had the ability and force of the noted Corralat.</p>

<p>In 1639 Almonte subdues the fierce Guimbanos, a mountain people in
Sulu. Later, they and the Joloans rebel, and in 1643&ndash;44
Agust&iacute;n de Cepeda again chastises them, defeating the natives in
several battles and ravaging their country. One of these expeditions is
related in detail by a Jesuit in Jol&oacute;, who, as usual, ascribes
the success of the Spaniards to the favor of St. Ignatius and the
Virgin Mary. In Mindanao, Corcuera&rsquo;s invasion (1637) long
restrains Corralat; but in 1655 he treacherously causes the murder of
three Spanish envoys sent to him and attempts (but in vain) to stir up
the other Moro rulers to rebellion against the Spaniards. The latter
are not strong enough to wage war with him, and therefore <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>overlook his
insolence; this encourages him to begin anew his piratical raids
against other islands. At this, several attempts are made to curb them,
most proving ineffectual&mdash;although in January&ndash;February,
1658, Esteybar with a squadron of armed vessels, destroys several
Mindanao villages. Finally (in 1662) the Manila authorities decide to
abandon their forts in Mindanao and Jol&oacute;; this causes the loss
of Spanish dominion there, and the christianized Moros soon relapse
into their former heathenism. Some of the Joloan chiefs make
unauthorized raids on the northern islands, but their king punishes
them and restores the captives. Corralat meanwhile, in his old age,
maintains peace, and charges his heir to do the same&mdash;an example
which is followed by the king of Jol&oacute;. The Camucones are kept in
awe by the light galleys which are built at Manila for this purpose.
Thus the latter part of the century is a time of comparative peace, so
far as the relations of the Spaniards and Visayans with the Moros are
concerned.</p>

<p>[From a letter by Father Juan de Zarzuela,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e345src" href="#xd0e345">1</a> June 19, 1691.]</p>

<p>The governor Don Fausto Cruzat y Gongora is a royal official in
these islands, who makes every endeavor to collect the revenue of his
Majesty. He has a hasty disposition, and no one dares oppose him;
consequently there are few who wish him well, and there is no one who
desires the office of alcalde, on account of the burdens that he
imposes on them (never customary here), of completing every year the
royal revenue and its accounts, and filling out the quota of what they
must collect, even though they do not actually collect it. The result
is, that the alcaldes contribute from their own stores what they had
not collected; for, no matter what efforts they make, they cannot
during the year finish the collections, on account of the extreme
poverty of the Indians. The governor has for counselors or intimates
only Andaya and Antonio, for whom he does many things <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>and confers many
offices. It is not known how much it costs them. His Lordship brought
over a great amount of silver from the viceroy, which is necessarily
sent as an investment; and there will be many who complain of this,
because [the goods procured by] it will occupy the greater part of the
ship. For this reason no one wished to accept command of the ship, for
it will be nothing more than to go in the governor&rsquo;s employ; and
finally it was given to Don Jos&eacute; Mato Rayo. It is a new ship
which is sailing; it was built by Andaya as contractor, and
superintendent of the whole&mdash;whom the governor obeyed, as one who
was necessary to him, because there was no ship that could be sent.
That is, the &ldquo;Santo Ni&ntilde;o&rdquo; was in such a condition
that it could not be repaired; and, as the time was short (it was then
only nine months), it was necessary to multiply the exactions [<i lang= 
"es">sacas</i>]. Thus Silang, which has two hundred and twenty-seven
and a half tributes registered, had one hundred and twenty men at one
time outside of their village; others had seventy, eighty, or more
out&mdash;without being able to take care of their grain-fields.
Afterward, because there was not enough rice for the king, through lack
of foresight in the royal officials, they levied another assessment of
rice on the natives [in Cavite] as also in La Laguna, the king paying
but one-half of what the Indians could sell it for later, and leaving
them under the necessity of buying the grain at double price. The worst
thing is, that now the rice has become so scarce that it is worth nine
and ten reals, at which price it is sold in the [royal] magazines; and
the tribute which is given by the very Indians on whom this purchase
was levied is sold at the magazines, without being placed <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>therein, to the
rice-mills. This gentleman very willingly accepts what people give him
for the offices. At the beginning, it was understood that he would not
receive gifts; but with five children, a wife, and a sister-in-law, and
heavily indebted, the office costing him so much, and he coming so
great a distance, how can he avoid looking out for money? He is not
opposed to the Society [of Jesus], but we are under no obligation to
him. Our order has no kindly feeling toward thieves, and it is thought
most probable, as nearly as can be guessed, that he will not speak [of
us] very favorably to his Majesty. He says that he will despatch the
balandra<a class="noteref" id="xd0e357src" href="#xd0e357">2</a> this
year; but I do not know how this will be, because they have not begun
to get it ready.</p>

<p>[From a letter by Father Magino Sola, June 19, 1691.]</p>

<p>On the twenty-fifth of July, Se&ntilde;or Fausto Cruzat y Gongora
took possession of the government. When Don Juan de Vargas was ready to
embark this year, the city brought a new suit against him, and seized
the little that he possessed.</p>

<p>[From a letter by Father Juan de Montemayor, dated July 4,
1694.]</p>

<p>He says therein that information had been received in Manila that
the Dominicans would not be promoted to bishoprics in the Filipinas
Islands, a statement that had been well received. The bishop of Troya
had attempted to regain the government of the archbishopric, founding
his claim on a royal decree <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href= 
"#pb36">36</a>]</span>in which he was charged to surrender it to the
person who had been presented by his Majesty (from which he inferred
that the king approved his government), but slighting the imperative
order [<i lang="es">ruego y encargo</i>] that he should set out for
Espa&ntilde;a. He demanded that the governor send him the official
correspondence from Espa&ntilde;a for the governor of the
archbishopric; but the governor replied that he would send him that
which should go to the name of his illustrious Lordship.</p>

<p>[Letter by Father Pedro de Silva Alencastre, July 20, 1694.]</p>

<p>[He says] that for three years past no letters from the islands
reached Mejico, because in July of the year 1692 the patache which was
going to the Marianas, with more than twenty thousand pesos, was burned
while in the very port. In the same year the ship &ldquo;Santo
Cristo&rdquo; sailed for Acapulco, and had to come back to this port
from the thirtieth degree of latitude. Then she sailed in July of 93,
from the port of Naga; and up to the present time nothing is known
about her fate. In 1694 a galleon was built that was 72 cubits long [<i
lang="es">de 72 codos de quilla</i>], an audacious attempt. It set sail
on the eve of St. Peter&rsquo;s day; and on the following Saturday,
while off the shore of Maragondon, it went to pieces. It was laden with
more than twelve thousand packages; for all the citizens had invested
whatever they possessed, in order to lade this ship, and even the
wrought silver and the jewels of the women had been sold in order to
invest their value in stuffs. The letter was sent by the patache which
the governor was despatching as an express, so that they might know in
Mejico and Espa&ntilde;a that the islands were not destroyed. <span

<p>[Letter by Father Gaspar Marco,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e386src"
href="#xd0e386">3</a> July 27, 1694.]</p>

<p>The bishop of Troya was going on, thinking that the government of
the archbishopric belonged to him, and did not ordain the clerics who
presented dismissory letters from the cabildo of Manila&mdash;assuming
that the king regarded him as ecclesiastical governor&mdash;and that,
in spite of the permit for absence which commanded him to return to
Espa&ntilde;a. The cabildo had brought suit against Doctor Nicolas
Caraballo, sentencing him to exile in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. He embarked
in the year 1692; but, the galleon having come back to the port of Naga
in the province of Camarines, the bishop of that diocese not only
received and entertained Caraballo, but absolved him and qualified him
to hold any office or benefice. The cabildo of Manila, who had sent a
person to conduct Caraballo to that city, endured this slight and said
nothing, when they knew of the conduct of the bishop of Camarines, in
order not to arouse another dispute. The bishop appointed Caraballo
governor of the bishopric of Cebu, on account of the death of its
prelate, in 1692. He began his rule by visiting and punishing the
curas, until he removed the cura of Aclan, named Salazar, and seized
his goods, without allowing him any appeal to the metropolitan. Salazar
escaped to Manila, and informed the cabildo of this; and they
commissioned the cantor, Don Esteban de Olmedo, to arrest Caraballo.
The bishop of Camarines had information of all this, and went in person
to protect him. He arrived twenty-four hours after <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>Olmedo, and arrested
the latter; he passed sentence on him, with the counsel and opinion of
Caraballo himself, and carried Olmedo to Camarines with a pair of
fetters, where he remained until the date [of the letter], without the
cabildo having taken any steps for his liberation. <span class=

<h2 class="normal">Discovery of the Palaos Islands</h2>

<p><i>Letters written from Manila, June 10, 1697, by Father Paul
Clain<a class="noteref" id="xd0e400src" href="#xd0e400">1</a> of the
Society of Jesus to Reverend Father Tirso Gonzalez, general of the same
Society, on the new discovery that has been made of thirty-two islands,
south of the Marianas Islands.</i></p>

<p>After the departure of the vessel which was commissioned with the
letters which I wrote during the year past to your Paternity, there
arrived another which brought me the order to accompany the reverend
father Antonio Fuccio,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e406src" href=
"#xd0e406">2</a> of Sicily, the new provincial of this province. Making
with him the circuit of our houses, I have taken a survey of the
country of the Pintados. There are large islands separated from one
another by arms of the sea, in which the tide renders navigation
difficult and dangerous. There are in these islands seventy-seven
thousand Christians, under the spiritual direction of forty-one <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>missionaries
of our Society, who have with them two of our brothers who provide for
their subsistence.</p>

<p>I can scarcely express to you, my reverend Father, how I have been
moved at the sight of these poor Indians, of whom there are many who
die without receiving the sacraments of the church, in great danger of
their eternal salvation: because there are so few priests here, that
the majority of them have charge of two villages at the same time. When
it happens that they are occupied in one place, fulfilling the
functions of their ministry, they are not able to assist those who die
in the other. I have been still more greatly moved by the forsaken
condition in which we found several other persons, who died in the
islands that are called Pais. Although these islands are not far from
the Marianas, their inhabitants have no intercourse with those of the
latter group. The discovery of this new country has this year been made
certain, as is here recounted.</p>

<p>In making the visitation with the father provincial, as I have
already said, we arrived at the village of Guivam,<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e415src" href="#xd0e415">3</a> on the island of Samal, the
largest and southernmost island of the Eastern Pintados. We found there
twenty-nine Palaos, or natives of these newly-discovered islands. The
easterly winds which rule over these seas from the month of December to
the month of May had blown them three hundred leguas from their islands
to this village on the island of Samal. They had come on two small
vessels, that are called here &ldquo;paraos.&rdquo; This is how they
relate their adventure. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href=
"#pb43">43</a>]</span></p>

<p>They had embarked, thirty-five persons in all, intending to go to a
neighboring island, when there arose a wind so violent that they were
not able to gain the island where they wished to land, or any other in
the neighborhood, and were carried out to the open sea. They made many
efforts to land on some shore or some island known to them, but without
avail. They sailed thus at the will of the winds during seventy days
without being able to make land. Finally losing all hope of returning
to their country, and seeing themselves half-dead with hunger, without
water and without food, they resolved to abandon themselves to the
mercy of the winds, and land on the first island they could find toward
the west. Scarcely had they taken this resolution, when they found
themselves in sight of the village of Guivam on the island of Samal. A
man from that village who was on the seashore saw them, and, judging by
the structure of their little vessels that they were some strangers who
had lost their way, he took a piece of cloth and made them a signal to
enter by the channel that he indicated, in order to avoid the rocks and
the banks of sand upon which they were about to run aground. These poor
men were so frightened at seeing this stranger that they began to put
back to sea; however much effort they made, they were not able to turn
about, and the wind blew them a second time toward the shore. When they
were near, the Guivam man made them understand by signs the route that
they should take; but, seeing that they were not taking it, and that
they would surely be lost, he threw himself into the sea, and swam to
one of those two small vessels, with the design of acting as pilot and
of conducting them safely to port. Scarcely <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb44" href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>had he reached the vessel when
those who were on board, even the women carrying their children, threw
themselves into the water to gain the other vessel, so much did they
fear the approach of this stranger. This man, seeing himself alone in
the small vessel, followed after them; and, having entered into the
second, he cleared all the rocks and piloted it safely into the harbor.
During this time the poor people remained motionless, and gave
themselves up to the guidance of the stranger, whose prisoners they
considered themselves.</p>

<p>They landed on St. Innocent&rsquo;s day, the twenty-eighth of
December of the year 1696. The inhabitants of Guivam gathered on the
shore, received them with charity, and brought them some wine and some
food. They ate eagerly some cocoanuts, which are the fruit of the palms
of this country. The meat in them is somewhat like that of chestnuts,
except that it has more oil, and that it furnishes a kind of sweetened
water which is agreeable to drink. The natives presented them with rice
boiled in water, which the people use here and in all of Asia, as one
does bread in Europe. They looked at it with wonder, and took some
grains of it, which they immediately threw on the ground, imagining
that they were worms. They exhibited much pleasure when some of the
large roots that are called <i>palavan</i> were brought to them, and
eagerly ate them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the natives brought two women whom the wind had thrown
upon the same shore at Guivam some time before. As they knew a little
of the language of this country, they served as interpreters, and it is
through them that we learned what I am about to relate. One of those
women found among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href=
"#pb47">47</a>]</span>these strangers some of her kindred, and they no
sooner recognized each other than they began to weep. The father who
had charge of this village, having learned of the arrival of these poor
people, had them come to Guivam. Some, when they saw him and perceived
the respect that was shown him, imagined that he was the king of the
country, and that their lives and their fate were in his hands. In this
belief they threw themselves upon the ground to implore his mercy, and
to beg that he would grant them their lives. The father, touched with
compassion at seeing them in such great desolation, did all that he
could to console them; and, to mitigate their fears, he caressed their
children, of whom three were still at the breast, and five others a
trifle older, and promised their parents to give them all the help that
was in his power.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Guivam vied with each other in offering to the
father to take the strangers into their houses, and to furnish them
with all things that they needed, both food and clothing. The father
committed the strangers to them, but on condition that they should not
separate those who were married (for there were some married ones among
them); and that they should not take less than two together, for fear
that those who were left alone would die of grief. Of thirty-five who
had come aboard the ships there now remained no more than thirty; five
had died during the voyage, because of the lack of food and the
privations of the long journey. A little while after their arrival
still another died, who had the good fortune to receive holy
baptism.</p>

<p>They said that their country consisted of thirty-three islands. They
cannot be very far from the Marianas, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb48" href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>to judge from the structure of their
vessels, and by the form of their sails, since these are of the same
style. There is strong indication that these islands are farther to the
south than the Marianas, in eleven or twelve degrees north latitude,
and upon the same parallel as Guivam; since the strangers came straight
from the east to the west, and landed on the shore at this settlement.
There is also ground for believing that this is one of the islands that
was discovered from afar some years ago. A vessel belonging to the
Philippines (in 1686) having left the customary route, which is from
east to west upon the thirteenth parallel, and having veered somewhat
toward the southwest, saw it for the first time. These people called
this island Carolina, in honor of the king (Charles II, king of Spain);
and the others called it St. Barnabas, because it was discovered on the
day when the church celebrates the feast of this apostle. This island
was seen last year by another vessel that the tempest had blown out of
its course, in going from here to the Marianas Islands. The governor of
the Philippines had often given orders to the ship which went nearly
every year to the Marianas, to seek for this island and the others that
were thought to be near; but these orders had been useless, God
reserving to this time the discovery of them, and as we hope, the
complete conversion of these people.</p>

<p>The strangers added that of these thirty-three islands there were
three which were inhabited only by birds, but that the others were
thickly peopled. When asked what was the number of the inhabitants,
they took a grain of sand or of dust, and intimated to the father in
this fashion, the innumerable multitude <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb49" href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>of men who lived there. These islands
are named Pais, Lamululutup, Saraon, Yaropie, Valayyay, Satavan, Cutac,
Yfaluc, Piraulop, Ytai, Pic, Piga, Lamurrec, Puc, Falait, Caruvaruvong,
Ylatu, Lamuliur, Tavas, Saypen, Tacaulat, Rapiyang, Tavon, Mutacusan,
Piylu, Olatan, Palu, Cucumyat, Piyalucunung. The three which are only
inhabited by birds are Piculat, Hulutan, and Tagian. Lamurrec is the
largest of all these islands. It is where the king of all that country
holds his court. The chiefs of all those settlements submit to him.
There was found among these strangers one of the chiefs with his wife,
who is the daughter of a king. Although they may be half-naked, they
have manners and a certain air of dignity, which makes one recognize
well enough who they are. The husband has all his body painted with
certain lines, the arrangement of which forms various figures. The
other men of this tribe have also some similar lines, some of them more
than the others; but the women and the children do not have them at
all. There are nineteen men and ten women, of different ages. The
contour and the color of their faces are very similar to those of the
natives of the Philippines. The men have no other dress than a kind of
girdle which covers their loins and thighs, and which is wound several
times about their bodies. They have upon their shoulders more than an
ell and a half of coarse cloth, of which they make a kind of hood,
which they tie in front, and allow to hang carelessly behind. The men
and the women are dressed in the same fashion, except that the women
have their wearing apparel a little longer, descending from the waist
almost to the knees. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href=
"#pb50">50</a>]</span></p>

<p>Their language is different from that of the Philippines, and
resembles that of the Marianas Islands. Their manner of pronouncing
words is something like that of the Arabs. The woman who appears to be
of highest station has many rings and necklaces of tortoise-shell, that
are called here <i>carey</i>; and others of a material that is unknown
to us. This material, which somewhat resembles ambergris, is not
transparent.</p>

<p>This is the manner in which they lived upon the sea during the
seventy days while they had been at the mercy of the waves. They threw
into the sea a sort of weir, made of several small branches of trees
tied together. This weir had a large opening to allow the fish to
enter, and ended in a point to prevent their going out. The fish that
they caught in this manner were all the nourishment they had, and they
did not drink any water except that which the rain furnished them; they
caught it in the shells of cocoanuts&mdash;which are the fruit of the
palms of this country, as I have already said; they are of the shape
and size of a man&rsquo;s skull.</p>

<p>There are no cows in those islands. The natives tried to run away
when they saw some cows browsing the grass, just as when they heard a
small dog bark in the house of the missionaries. There are neither cats
nor deer, nor horses, nor, in general, any four-legged beast. There are
but few birds, except those which live on the sea. They have, however,
fowls which they eat; but they never eat their eggs.</p>

<p>In spite of this lack of all things, they are happy and content with
their lot. They have some songs and dances in tolerably regular time.
They sing all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href=
"#pb51">51</a>]</span>together and make the same gestures, which has a
pleasing effect.</p>

<p>They are surprised at the government, the politeness, and the
manners of Europe, of which they have no knowledge. They admire not
only that august majesty of the ceremonies by which the church
celebrates divine worship, but also the music, the instruments, the
dances of the Spaniards, the weapons which they carry, and, above all,
the gunpowder. They admire also the whiteness of the Europeans; for the
inhabitants of this country are all of swarthy complexion.</p>

<p>They appear until now to have had no knowledge of God, nor do they
adore idols. We have noticed in them only a life altogether barbarous.
All their care is to seek for food and drink. They have a great
deference for their king and the chiefs of their villages, and they
obey them with the greatest exactitude. They do not have regular hours
for their meals. They drink and eat at any time and wherever they may
be, when they are hungry and thirsty, and when they find wherewith to
satisfy themselves. But they eat little at a time, and one of their
meals is not enough to suffice for all the day.</p>

<p>Their civility and mark of respect consists in taking the hand or
the foot of the one to whom they wish to do honor, and in rubbing it
gently over their face. They have among their possessions some saws not
made of iron, but of a large shell that is called here <i>
taclobo</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e465src" href="#xd0e465">4</a>
which they sharpen by rubbing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href= 
"#pb52">52</a>]</span>against certain stones. They have also one of
iron, as long as a finger. They were much astonished on the occasion of
a trading-vessel being built at Guivam, to see the great variety of
tools for carpentry which were used. They looked at all these, one
after another, with much wonder. They do not have metals in their
country. The father missionary gave them each a good-sized piece of
iron, which they received with more joy than if he had given them so
much gold. They had so much fear that it would be taken away from them
that they put it under their heads when they wanted to sleep. They do
not have any arms except lances or darts made of human bones. They are
very peaceful among themselves. When it happens that there is a quarrel
among them, it is settled by a few blows of their fists upon each
other&rsquo;s heads. But this rarely happens; because, if some wish to
come to blows, others separate them and make them stop the dispute.
They are not, nevertheless, stupid or heavy; on the contrary, they have
fire and vivacity. They are not as stout as the natives of the Marianas
Islands, but they are well proportioned, and of nearly the same height
as the Philippinos. Both men and women let their hair grow, which falls
upon their shoulders.</p>

<p>When these strangers learned that they were to be conducted into the
presence of the father missionary, they painted themselves all over the
body with a certain yellow color, which they consider a great
adornment. They are so satisfied at finding here in abundance all that
is necessary to life, that they have offered to return to their own
country in order to attract here their compatriots, and to persuade
them to enter into intercourse with these <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb55" href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>islands. Our governor is much pleased
with this design, in view of the fact that he has subjected all this
country to the king of Spain; and this would open a wide door for the
propagation of the gospel. The eldest of the strangers had once before
been thrown upon the coast of the province of Caragan in one of these
islands; but, as he found only some infidels who dwelt in the mountains
and along these deserted shores, he had returned to his own country,
without having known of the abundance and the riches of these islands.
He had been more fortunate in this second voyage. The children have
already been baptized, and the others have been instructed in the
mysteries of our religion. They are very skilful in diving; and it is
said that they recently found, while fishing, two large pearls in the
shells, which they threw back into the sea, because they did not know
their value.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e482src" href=
"#xd0e482">5</a></p>

<p>I write you all this, my reverend Father, persuaded that you will be
glad to learn news so advantageous to those of your children who have
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>good
fortune to carry the faith into this new country. We have need of
workers, for there is much work to do. We hope that you will have the
kindness to send some workers to us, and will not forget us in your
holy devotions. I am with profound respect, my very reverend Father,
your Paternity&rsquo;s very humble and obedient servant and son,</p>

<p>... 2. From the beginning of the year 1660, the Indians of Pampanga,
a province not far from the city of Manila in Philipinas, incited by
many grievous annoyances unjustly caused by the superintendent of
timber cutting, which was ordered to be done within their boundaries by
the governor of the islands, Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara, determined
to withdraw themselves from the yoke of the Spanish dominion. Although
that dominion is very mild <i>per se</i>, some subordinate government
employes generally make it intolerable, for tyrannically availing
themselves of the name of the king, they endeavor to trample everything
under foot. The Pampangos elected as leader a master-of-camp of their
own nation, one Don Francisco Many&agrave;go. He clutched the staff of
office as though it were a scepter. Although this insurrection caused
considerable fear in Manila at the beginning, since the Pampango nation
is so warlike, yet since at the same time, its individuals are the most
reasonable of the islands, the governor hastening thither in person
together with many religious of various orders (for the religious form
the most powerful army for quieting the Indians) the whole disturbance
was readily quieted by means of negotiation. Justice was done them in
their grievances, while no punishment was omitted, and was administered
to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href=
"#pb59">59</a>]</span>seditious leaders. Fathers Fray Joseph de la
Annunciacion, and Fray Juan de San Antonio, ex-provincials of our
Family, together with fathers Fray Carlos de Jesus, and Fray Juan de
San Diego, were of considerable aid in that pacification. Those
fathers, exposing themselves to not few dangers, had the boldness to go
to some of the principal Indians, who were their acquaintances, whom by
dint of their persuasion, they succeeded in bringing back to reason.
And by their means, discussion and friendly agreements having been
introduced, those so harmful insurrections were put down.</p>

<p>3. But at the beginning of their insurrection, the Pampangos had
written many letters to the provinces of Pangasin&agrave;n,
Il&ograve;cos, and Cagay&agrave;n, which lie farther north in the
island of Luzon. In those letters they assured the inhabitants of those
provinces that they had risen with so great force that they had no
doubt but that they could gain Manila by force of arms. They besought
those people to heed the common cause, for once that the Spanish yoke
was thrown off, they could all get together in firm friendship and
relations, and maintain their liberty, by electing a king to govern
them, or become feared by the other nations under the form of a
republic. Those were counsels which like a cancer in the human body,
continued to spread in the civil affairs of those provinces, and the
majority of the Indians followed them with only too great rapidity.
Hence, when the Indians of Pampanga were quieted they were incapable of
extinguishing the fire that they themselves had kindled.</p>

<p>4. In Pangasin&agrave;n, Il&ograve;cos, and Cagay&agrave;n, the
flame acquired too much force because of the fierceness <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>of the well arranged
combustibles, which were applied by several Indian chiefs, who
endeavored, under the specious name of liberty, to oppress in the most
intolerable manner the ones who did not recognize the blessings which
they had while they had the good fortune to call themselves a part of
the Spanish monarchy. But in order that this history may not wander
into parts that do not belong to it, we shall treat only of what
happened in the province of Pangasin&agrave;n; for one part of that
province, namely the territory of Zamb&agrave;les, which is composed of
ten villages, was then, and is also at present, cultivated in regard to
spiritual matters by our holy Recollect order. On that account our
religious necessarily suffered considerably, and they aided in the
pacification of the Indians, as did the other holy orders in the
villages entrusted to their care.</p>

<p>5. At the end, then, of the year 1660, the insurgents of
Pangasin&agrave;n elected as their leader an Indian chief of the
village of Binalat&ograve;ngan, one Don Andr&egrave;s M&agrave;long. He
having usurped the title of king, went to Campa&ntilde;a, escorted by
nine thousand Indian warriors. This number was increased enormously
within a few days; for it was either a boast of the rebels and they so
published it, or it was a fact, his army was composed of forty thousand
men. An Indian noble, by the name of Don Francisco Sum&ugrave;lay, a
very near relative of M&agrave;long, was living in Bolin&agrave;o, a
village within our administration. On account of that relationship he
looked upon his progress as his own, and helped him as much as he could
to attain his purposes. He, in order to incite Bolin&agrave;o and its
environs to revolt, spared no effort that he considered fitting. But
the father <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href=
"#pb61">61</a>]</span>prior, Fray Juan de la Madre de Dios (or
Blancas), opposed him openly and in secret, destroying with cunning
whatever Sum&ugrave;lay wrought deceitfully. No sooner did the
restlessness and excited condition of the Indians force him to take
prudent precautions, than he caused ten soldiers to disembark from a
champan which was on its way to Cagay&agrave;n. The latter obeyed him
for the captain agreed thereto, and because they knew how much the
governor of the islands favored the above-named religious, and that he
would approve whatever was done with the latter&rsquo;s advice. The
father found himself somewhat ready to offer resistance with those
soldiers and with the faithful Indians, who by dint of his persuasions
were not few; but he had not sufficient forces to attack the rebels or
to seize the wicked Sum&ugrave;lay, who was the cause of all the
disorder.</p>

<p>6. The latter starting a rumor that the hostile Mindan&agrave;os
were in the neighborhood, imagined that by that false report, and by
setting fire to the convent and church at night, the soldiers would
flee to the mountains, and that the religious and the loyal Indians of
the village would imitate them. It would then follow that, since he
would remain behind with the insurgents who were already thoroughly
advised, he would be able, after having conquered the port and
settlement at his safety, to kill all who were not of his party. Those
ideas were not very badly conceived, and had they arrived at the
desired success, would have been only too potent for the attainment of
his malicious purpose. For, after the surrender of Bolin&agrave;o,
would doubtless follow that of all the territory of Zamb&agrave;les,
and then, the great difficulty of maritime aid from Manila to
Pangasin&agrave;n, a circumstance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>which gave great strength to the revolt. But
the same arguments also served the father prior to procure the
preservation of Bolin&agrave;o with the greatest watchfulness. Hence
scarcely had Sum&ugrave;lay fired the edifice, when the soldiers and
loyal Indians protecting it, and fortifying themselves as well as they
could, maintained the village in the faith for their God, and in the
loyalty due their king. It is a fact that while attending to that, the
church was reduced to ashes, as were the sacristy and most of the
convent. But that was considered as a little loss as it was well
employed, so long as the enemy did not attain their purpose.</p>

<p>7. The above happened in the early part of December, when authentic
tidings were not known in Bolin&agrave;o of the insurrection, and only
various movements were descried in the Indians which provoked fear.
However, they had been compelled to dissimulate through lack of forces.
But on the twentieth day of the above-mentioned month, the conspiracy
was finally published in the village, and Sim&ugrave;lay and his
associates notified the religious in the following manner. In front of
the cells of the father prior and of his associate father Fray Luis de
San Joseph, were placed two bamboos and at the end of them two
cocoanuts. That is a barbarous ceremony of those countries by which to
threaten one with decapitation. Sim&ugrave;lay thought that that would
be sufficient to frighten the fathers and make them abandon the
village, and especially since they now had no soldiers, as the soldiers
mentioned above had proceeded on their way. But he was mistaken in his
reckoning, for although father Fray Luis was of that opinion, and
Indian chiefs were not wanting who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63"
href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>supported him, either because they were
already infected with the rebellion, or, perhaps, in order to assure
the lives of the fathers, were carried away by their good zeal, the
father prior resolved to die rather than fail in his service to God and
the king. He did not change his decision, however much the sign was
repeated the following day. On the contrary, he considered the time
suitable to ascertain and establish with cunning the degree of the
fidelity of his parishioners. He convened the Indians in the atrium of
the convent, and in eloquent and powerful arguments gave them to
understand that God having entrusted their souls to him, he would not
leave their land, although he knew that he was to suffer a thousand
martyrdoms. &ldquo;I am not ignorant,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the
aim of those who occasion these insurrections is to apostatize from the
Catholic faith, and to return to their former paganism; but for that
same reason, I must oppose myself to that with the greatest strength.
Go ahead, send news of my constancy to the partisans of the rebel
M&agrave;long, if perchance there are any in the village, so that they
may not tire themselves with threatening me with death. Assure them
that I shall consider myself very fortunate, if I transform myself into
a good martyr from so poor a priest. But meanwhile, I warn you, that I
shall know by each one&rsquo;s actions who are the rebels and who are
faithful; and that accordingly the proper reward or punishment will
follow each one, when the Manila fleet, which will not delay, subdues
affairs properly.&rdquo; By that effort some who were wavering in their
loyalty were confirmed in it, while those who were on the side of the
seditious ones did not dare to put their treacherous thoughts into
execution. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href=
"#pb64">64</a>]</span></p>

<p>8. Very soon did experience show the great importance of the
firmness of so valiant a religious. For on the night of that same day,
after the convent was locked, some of the loyal Indians, who were
guarding the outside of it, captured a strange Indian, who declared
that he was bringing a message to the father prior, which was to be
given into his own hand. He was taken into the father&rsquo;s presence
after observing the necessary precautions, where he delivered the
message. It was from the father vicar of Lingay&egrave;n and contained
extensive notices of the insurrection of Pangasin&agrave;n which had
broken out, the murder of the alcalde-mayor, and the devastation of
that part of so flourishing a province. He sent letters for his
provincial and for the governor of the islands, in which a speedy
relief was asked in order that the sedition might be stifled at its
beginning. He besought the father prior to send them quickly to Manila,
as it was impossible to send them from Pangasin&agrave;n overland. And
now it is seen that if the father prior, Fray Juan de la Madre de Dios,
had retired from Bolin&agrave;o as fear persuaded him, that despatch
would have been fruitless, and perhaps had those advices been unknown
in Manila, Pangasin&agrave;n would have been endangered; but since he
remained inflexible against the incentives of fear, he was able to take
the fitting means, in order that the promptest and most efficacious aid
might be obtained.</p>

<p>9. It was not considered advisable to entrust the conveyance of such
letters to the Indians of Bolin&agrave;o, and accordingly it was
resolved to despatch father Fray Luis de San Joseph overland to
Masingloc under the pretext that he was going on affairs connected with
the spiritual administration, but his real <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb65" href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>purpose was to deliver the
messages to the minister of the said village, in order that the latter
might despatch them. The religious exposed himself to evident danger of
death; for the village of Agno, through which he could not avoid
passing, was almost entirely in insurrection, and because in the
stretch extending from the territory of Agno to that of B&agrave;lcac,
it was necessary to take the rough sea in a small fishing boat which
carried no sail and only one oar with the religious himself at the
helm. At last he reached Masingloc, after conquering so great an
obstacle. Thence, not without the most serious dangers, the minister
sent the messages to Manila, arranging to have them carried by father
Fray Bernardino de la Concepcion, accompanied by three of the most
faithful chiefs. One of those chiefs was appointed master-of-camp by
the governor as a reward for so excellent a service, another,
sargento-mayor, and the third, captain of the militia of his village;
and they were exempted for life from paying tribute. And since the
father vicar of Lingay&egrave;n despatched a second mail to
Bolin&agrave;o in case that the first should fail, the father prior,
Fray Juan de la Madre de Dios, despatched the letters in a Chinese
vessel which made a way-station there, and was on its way from the
island of Hermosa to Manila. But while the army and naval fleet are
being prepared in that city, in order to take relief to
Pangasin&agrave;n, let us return to our villages of Zamb&agrave;les, in
order to see what is happening there, and the dangers by which our
religious were afflicted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href= 
"#pb66">66</a>]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="div4">
<h5 class="normal">&sect; II</h5>

<p><i>Continuation of the foregoing matter, with the declaration of
what happened to our religious in Masingloc, Cagay&agrave;n, Agno, and
Bolin&agrave;o.</i></p>

<p>10. With the absence of the three said chiefs in Masingloc, the
prior found himself greatly troubled and persecuted, for those who
favored the rebellion, who had thitherto not dared to show their faces
in public, showed openly the most foul face of treason on the day of
St. Stephen. They threw the village into such consternation that if God
had not aided it, it would have been impossible to restore it to its
former quiet. It happened that, as some Indians had not been at mass on
either the eve or day of the nativity, the prior meeting one of them
afterward who was most esteemed for his bravery, chid him for his
fault, although with demonstrations of paternal charity. He had no
intentions of exasperating him, for he knew quite well that the Indian
was inducing his countrymen to swell the number of the insurgents by
persuasion and threat. But the Indian would not suffer the mild rebuke
for that sin, which in other circumstances would have made him
experience the severities of punishment, and deeming the occasion very
suitable for the revolt of the village, he began to pretend implacable
annoyance because the father admonished him. Following this, he became
excessively angry, and hurled many insults at the evangelical minister,
and concluded by crying out: &ldquo;Long live M&agrave;long! Death to
the Spaniards and the fathers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>11. By that means the Indian obtained his desires, for more than
fifty armed companions gathered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67"
href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>about him. They proclaimed the traitor
M&agrave;long as king; hacked the Spanish coat-of-arms which was placed
on the site where the <i lang="es">principales</i> met to administer
justice; and they obliged the prior, whom it was a miracle of divine
Providence that they did not kill instantly, to retire to his convent,
where a guard was established by means of some Indians who could be
gathered together, while many others who were of the loyal party, were
oppressed in their homes. There they held the prior and those who
accompanied them besieged, and did not allow them to communicate with
the outside, and refused to allow any kind of food to be taken to them,
trying by this means to restrict them to the heighth of necessity.
Within the danger was so much greater, as it was less known by the
loyal villages near by which could have sent them some aid. If the
rebels did not attack the convent in order to kill the loyal ones, it
was because they were afraid of some few arquebuses with which those of
the inside threatened them. But they endeavored to set fire to the
convent and church three times without being able to succeed,
notwithstanding that the material of the building was but little less
combustible than tinder, for it was all constructed of wood, bamboo,
and nipa. Those who tried to burn that edifice, regarded that as a
miracle. Moreover, one can well understand the necessity that they
suffered for they had no place whence to get relief, not even for the
necessities of life. Consequently they were placed at the will of the
divine Providence, who as is His custom with those in tribulation, very
quickly declared His patronage.</p>

<p>12. Having passed the time in this way until New Year&rsquo;s eve,
it was noted then that a medium-sized <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb68" href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>vessel was anchored not far from the
convent, and that almost all of its Indians having landed, engaged in a
very interesting conversation with the insurgents. On that account, the
prior and his men had an opportunity, to leave the convent without
being perceived, to go to the beach, and make themselves masters of the
above-mentioned vessel. They set sail without loss of time in it. Thus
freed from their peril they took their course toward Manila. But as
they were in need of food, they put in at Bag&agrave;c, where they met
the three chiefs who had guided father Fray Bernardino, and were now
returning to their village. They recounted to those chiefs the
deplorable condition in which they were; and considering that the
remedy for wrongs generally lies in quickness, they determined to take
thirty well-armed Indians, whom the father minister of Bag&agrave;c
prepared, and who were fortunately at that place; and then retracing
their way, to attack Masingloc suddenly. They hoped that if they
attacked the rebels when they appeared to be most secure, it would not
be difficult to reduce them all to their former quiet. So did it
happen, for the season favoring them, they disembarked on the night of
the third of January in a bay one-half hour&rsquo;s distance from
Masingloc, and went overland to that village. At dawn of the fourth,
they surprised the insurgents so completely, that overtaken by fear,
the latter could not put themselves in a state of defense, while they
even had no opportunity for flight. They were all seized, and the
prior, although he was full of grief at the robbery of the sacristy and
church, interceded for the prisoners, and succeeded in having all
except three set at liberty. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href= 
"#pb69">69</a>]</span>Those three were the leaders and later paid for
their wickedness on the gallows.</p>

<p>13. In Cigay&egrave;n (a village which had decreased very sensibly
in houses and inhabitants since the violent death of the venerable
father, Fray Alonso de San Agustin, in the year 1612), was father Fray
Francisco de San Agustin, an especially zealous minister, who was
applying all the persuasive powers of his eloquence to retaining the
remnants of that great settlement in due fidelity to God and the king.
But a chief, called Don Antonio S&igrave;rray, desired the contrary, in
order to keep things in confusion for his own profit. Knowing that he
would have no opportunity so long as father Fray Francisco was living,
he tried to kill him twice, but the religious man was delivered from
his ambushes, for God took his part in a very visible and special
manner. In the discussion that the two had together, (one persuading to
good, and the other inducing to evil), it happened that S&igrave;rray
and all his partisans went to swell the army of M&agrave;long. The
loyal Indians with their families and possessions went to another
village; father Fray Francisco retired to Manila. With that the village
was completely abandoned and no more thought was expended on its
rebuilding. Such harm do dissensions cause, when, because there is no
strength to attack them, they increase to the highest degree when
agitated by violence.</p>

<p>14. In Agno (a visita or annex of Bolin&agrave;o), there was a chief
called Don Juan D&ugrave;rrey, a very near relative of Sum&ugrave;lay,
and consequently he was bound up very closely to the rebels. Three
Spaniards reached that place on Christmas day, who were <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>fleeing from the
insurgents of Pangasin&agrave;n. They showed the Indians a diamond
ring, as a reward or payment for something to eat, for they were
suffering dire need. But scarcely had they sat down to table, when
D&ugrave;rrey inhumanly killed them. As father Fray Luis de San Joseph
(who was returning from Masingloc whither he had taken the messages as
related above), was passing in the afternoon toward Bolin&agrave;o, he
noted the loud shouts in the village, caused by the feasting and
dancing that they made according to their custom with the heads of the
three Spaniards. He attempted to approach nearer in order to check
their inhumanity, but an Indian instigated by the devil, scarcely saw
the father when he threw two spears at him. It was regarded as a
miracle that the father escaped the blow and was not wounded. Thereupon
our valiant religious lifted up his voice, and loudly condemned so
unjust actions in a fervent sermon. According to circumstances, the
words on each occasion must have served as does music on the ears of
the tiger. But in the midst of the necessary disturbance, he was
enabled to tell them with the help of God, such things that
D&ugrave;rrey with twelve others who followed him, had to leave the
village. The others, humble and obedient to the voice of their
shepherd, surrendered the heads in order that he might give them
ecclesiastical burial. From that moment Agno remained in the greatest
quiet, like the sea, which shows the most exquisite quietness and
serenity after the most terrible storm.</p>

<p>15. But the place where the rage of the insurgents was felt more was
in Bolin&agrave;o. M&agrave;long regarded its minister, father Fray
Juan de la Madre de Dios, with irreproachable hatred, for he was not
unaware <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href=
"#pb71">71</a>]</span>of his great labor in restraining the Zambals.
They are so warlike a nation that they have always caused themselves to
be respected not only in Pangasin&agrave;n, which province they glorify
as a not despicable part, but also throughout the Philipinas Islands
where they have been able to acquire renown through their arms. Having,
then, as we have related, sent his associate to Masingloc, he
considered that the Indians left him alone in the convent, and that
they were going about cautiously talking one with another. He summoned
one of the chiefs to him and chid him for that coldness. He learned
from the Indian that Don Francisco Cauc&agrave;o, a cousin of the
usurping king, had arrived from Binalat&ograve;ngon with an order to
the effect that the Zambals should declare against the Spaniards, under
pain of being treated as rebels if they did not do so. The Indian added
that Cauc&agrave;o was staying in Sum&ugrave;lay&rsquo;s house, and
they were afraid that he intended to conquer their countrymen, and that
was the reason why they were all so confused. Without allowing, then,
the talk which generally increases dangers beyond what they are in
themselves, the religious father set out for Sum&ugrave;lay&rsquo;s
house in order to have an interview with Cauc&agrave;o, as well as for
the purpose of examining and exploring the village, in order to see
whether there were any ambuscades about it.</p>

<p>16. After he was assured that there were no strange enemies, he went
into the presence of the Indian, who received him seated, without
showing him the least sign of respect. The father asked him why he
came, and he answered haughtily that his cousin Don Andres
M&agrave;long, the powerful king of Pangasin&agrave;n, looking with
love on the Zambal nation, and not desiring <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb72" href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>to treat them with the greatest
rigor of war, sent him to inform them to recognize him as their
seignior, and that on that same day some papers were to be read in the
church in which that would be intimated; and that the father was to
reply to a letter written by his cousin the king, conceding whatever
was asked of him, for if he did not do so, it would cost him his life.
Another of less valor than father Fray Juan would doubtless have been
intimidated at the sight of such arrogance, especially when it be
considered that he could not be sure of the people of the village. But
the very injustice of the Indian giving the father courage, he said to
the chiefs who had accompanied him: &ldquo;What is this? What is this?
Can it be possible to write of the loyalty of Bolin&agrave;o, that a
traitor, sent by a rebel to God, and the king, publicly induces you to
insurrection, and that he remain unpunished? Come, seize him. But no,
it is to his advantage to have been found in the house of
Sum&ugrave;lay, whose nobility is worthy of this attention. But I warn
you, O wretch, that you do not leave the house which serves you as a
sanctuary, and that you do not sow any discord in order to pervert the
fidelity of the Zambals, until I have answered this letter of your
vicious cousin; for if you disobey my order, and these men do not tear
you to pieces, I shall be able to send you to Manila laden with irons
and chains, where you will pay for your treason on the
gallows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>17. Cauc&agrave;o, Sum&ugrave;lay, and all the others were full of
dismay at hearing the argument of the prior: Cauc&agrave;o, because he
thought that the village sided with the Spaniards since the father
spoke with so great assurance; Sum&ugrave;lay, because he imagined the
same, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href=
"#pb73">73</a>]</span>and because he thought also that the prior was
ignorant of his evil designs, since he spoke so lovingly to him; and
the others, because a rumor that had been shortly before cunningly
spread to the effect that a fleet was already coming from Manila to
punish those who had declared for M&agrave;long, was thus corroborated.
For, they argued, if it were not so, a poor religious would not have
the courage to do so much. In short the father prior obtained his wish,
namely, to puzzle them all in order to gain time. That done, the
venerable man retired to his convent quite perplexed. Opening the
letter, he beheld that M&agrave;long expressed himself in the same
manner as Cauc&agrave;o had done. He deemed best not to answer it, for
while he was thinking how he would dismiss the messenger, he was
advised that a champan had just anchored in the port, in which were two
religious. He proceeded thither in order to receive them, and was met
by fathers Fray Juan de Berg&agrave;ra and Fray Juan de Fisla, who were
retiring from Il&ograve;cos, where the rebels were committing
innumerable acts of cruelty, and had inhumanly taken the life of father
Fray Joseph Arias, all of our observance.</p>

<p>18. He led them to the convent, arranging also that two Spaniards
and six Tag&aacute;log Indians who could be withdrawn from the champan
without their loss being felt therein, should accompany them with
firearms. Then seeing that he was in a state of defense if anything
should be attempted by the rebels, he had Cauc&agrave;o and
Sum&ugrave;lay summoned. They came at the first notice, but curiosity
brought all the people of the village. Then the father tearing the
letter of M&agrave;long to pieces in the presence of the multitude,
said: &ldquo;This is the reply merited by such an arrogant <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>method of writing,
and especially since it is the letter of a traitor. You,&rdquo; he
proceeded, addressing Cauc&agrave;o, &ldquo;who have had the
shamelessness to come on so insolent an embassy, well merit being sent
a prisoner to Manila, and in order that I might do so, God has,
perhaps, presented me with this champan. But since you would go to the
gallows, the kindness of my estate does not allow me to cooperate in
the death of my neighbor. Therefore, get you gone immediately to
Binalat&ograve;ngon, and tell your cousin that I pity him, since the
fleet of Manila is already on its way to punish him. Assure him that
his threats make me laugh; that his demand for obedience from the
Zambal nation is irrational; and that I am sending him his relative
Sum&ugrave;lay in order to increase his army, besides twenty-five
Indians of this village, who are, according to appearances, looking
upon him with too much affection.&rdquo; The father designated those
persons by name, and added with a show of great anger: &ldquo;Not a
single one of those whom I have just named will remain in
Bolin&agrave;o, under penalty that whoever refuses to obey, he and the
one who hides him shall be sent to Manila without fail, where justice
will punish his resistance.&rdquo; Thus did he say, and then turned his
back with a show of so great anger that no one dared not to fulfil his
orders. On the contrary, all those comprehended in the order, left the
village immediately, for they feared the threat of punishment. By that
means after thus getting rid of the evil humors of that body politic
that troubled it, it remained in its former health, and the great and
estimable blessing of peace followed.</p>

<p>19. After the execution of so heroic an action, the father prior
endeavored to welcome his new <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href= 
"#pb75">75</a>]</span>guests, whom he provided with all that was
needful for the continuation of their journey to Manila. They set sail
December 26, leaving Ours behind especially sad, because we were
defenseless if the traitor M&agrave;long attempted any new persecution.
They were not deceived in their judgment, for the rebel angered at the
lack of effect produced by his letter, sent an order to Don Juan
D&ugrave;rrey, chief of the hamlet of Agno, to cut off the head of that
illustrious man without fail and to send it to him. That chief went to
Bolin&agrave;o accompanied by another valiant Indian, and entered the
convent for the feast of the new year. He found the prior praying
outside of his cell, and the good religious imagining that he was come
to ask aid, began to exhort him especially to be loyal and offered him
pardon in the king&rsquo;s name. God giving force to these words,
D&ugrave;rrey changed his intention, and refused to kill the father of
his spirit. But the Indian who accompanied him, shutting his ears, like
an asp, to the voices of health, seeing that his chief would not do the
deed, unsheathed a weapon called <i>igua</i> in those parts, and
approached quickly in order to strike the father. But since the chiefs
of the village who had come to speak with the prior on a matter of
moment, entered at the same time, the Indian was completely embarrassed
and both of them were greatly confused. Thus can God, by so casual
happenings, set a hindrance to even greater fatalities, making use of
the very occurrence of secondary causes in order to free His servants
from the dangers that threaten them.</p>

<p>20. It appears that M&agrave;long was not entirely satisfied with
the order that he had despatched to D&ugrave;rrey; for, aroused to
anger he also ordered Sum&ugrave;lay <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb76" href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>to return to Bolin&agrave;o in order
to cut off the prior&rsquo;s head, as well as the heads of all the
other religious whom he might find there. Sum&ugrave;lay obeyed
instantly, for he was confident that he still had some well inclined to
him in the village. He arrived at <span class="corr" id="xd0e646"
title="Source: might">night</span>, and waiting until the morning of
January 3, entered the convent at the time that the venerable minister
was about to go out with a rattan staff in his hand in order to go to
confess a sick man. Sum&ugrave;lay attacked him with a short sword,
without any waste of arguments. The poor religious, seeing himself
involved in the worst kind of a conflict, but infused with valor by the
divine hand, beat back the first blows with his cane, and defending
himself with it, just as he might have done with the best kind of a
sword, seeing that no one came to his aid, passed to the offensive. The
cane had a long sharp steel point and the father gave the aggressor so
powerful a blow or thrust in the breast, that he brought him to the
earth grievously wounded. Then the prior called out, whereupon the
village chiefs came up. However, they were remiss in arresting
Sum&ugrave;lay, but on the contrary favored his retreat, and allowed
him to go away after he recovered from his wound. Consequently, when
the prior returned from his confession (whither he had not omitted to
go, despite all the confusion), Sum&ugrave;lay no longer appeared. The
prior had to put a good face on regarding the ill behavior of his
parishioners, in order not to put the village in a worse condition,
which, at least publicly, did not aid the seditious ones as much as
they could have done. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href=

<p><i>Arrival of the Manila fleet which was aided by our religious.
Destruction of the rebels.</i></p>

<p>21. Having now related what happened in the villages of
Zamb&agrave;les, and the dangers which our religious suffered, let us
turn our eyes toward Manila, and see what preparations the government
was taking in order to meet so many depredations. Scarcely had father
Fray Bernardino de la Concepcion delivered his messages, when Don
Sabiniano Manriquez de Lara, governor of the islands, with
extraordinary quickness mustered an army of two hundred Spaniards,
besides four hundred other soldiers, consisting of Pamp&agrave;ngos,
negroes, mulattoes, and mestizos. As general he appointed the
master-of-camp, Francisco de Esteyb&agrave;r, a Visayan noble, who in
addition to his credit as so fine a soldier, appeared a most observant
religious in his habits. He was ordered to march overland to
Pangasin&agrave;n without loss of time. A fleet consisting of four
champans, two galleys, and six medium-sized vessels, which were manned
with many good soldiers, and a goodly supply of all sorts of firearms
were also prepared. This fleet was put in command of General Don
Phelipe de Ugalde, who was ordered to set out on the voyage at once,
and go to the port of Bolin&agrave;o, where he was to confer with the
father prior, Fray Juan de la Madre de Dios, whose counsel he was to
prize greatly. He was advised that he was not to attempt anything
ashore, until the arrival of Esteyb&agrave;r, and their forces were
united.</p>

<p>22. Everything was done in so short a time (to the contrary of what
is generally written of Spanish aid), that the father prior was advised
by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href=
"#pb78">78</a>]</span><i>bant&agrave;yes</i> or sentinels at dawn of
January 5, that several vessels were seen to be headed to the port,
which as was judged from their direction appeared to be from Manila. At
nine in the morning the fleet anchored in the port of Bolin&agrave;o,
which is about one-quarter legua from the village. The father prior
flew thither, with the rapidity of one who is in search of consolation,
for he was most afflicted. Scarcely was he descried on the beach, when
the general sent a skiff for him. He was taken by the skiff to the
flagship, where he was received with repeated salvos of artillery. All
the men expressed mutual joy, which sprung from the bottom of the
heart, and were not superficial and born from the habit of deceit.
Father Fray Bernardino de la Concepcion returned as chaplain of the
fleet, because he urged the father provincial that he might do so, for
he considered his absence from the field of battle, where his comrades
were accomplishing so much for the crown, dishonorable to his valor in
the spiritual militia. When the mutual congratulations which were
exchanged between the father prior and those who composed the relief
were exhausted, the general gave the former a letter from the governor.
It read as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Dear Father Fray Juan: Very sad has been the news that we
have had here of your Reverence and of the other fathers, and we were
even assured that you had all been killed. Consequently, the news from
your Reverence served me as a special source of joy, notwithstanding
the melancholy information contained therein of those insurrections. I
trust implicitly through God that your person will be kept safe for the
service of both Majesties. And I hope <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb79" href="#pb79">79</a>]</span>that that fleet which I have been
able to assemble quickly will keep you safe and that it will have your
Reverence&rsquo;s advice which I have ordered the general to receive as
you are a person of experience in that district. The army in charge of
General Esteyb&agrave;r is ordered to make forced marches. And next to
God, I look for success in all things to your Reverence because you are
there. May God preserve you, etc. Manila, January 2, 1661. <span class= 
"smallcaps">Don Sabiniano</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>23. The general and the prior then discussed many points in regard
to the order that was to be followed in the war. It was known that the
weapons of the insurgents were poisoned arrows which caused death
irremediably no matter how small a wound they made. And although there
is not wanting an antidote to counteract that danger, yet that secret
is known only by certain Indians who refused to disclose it because
they desired the insolent multitude to conquer. But the vigilance of
our religious had already shown its foresight in a matter of so great
weight, and availing himself of a chief of Bolin&agrave;o, one Don
Antonio D&agrave;cap, he had obtained from him the recipe for making
the antidote; and he had even prepared a large quantity of it, which he
gave to the general, in order that the latter might distribute it among
the men of the fleet, so that they might suffer no harm from the
arrows. Ugalde asked for some things which could not be prepared in
Manila on account of the haste [of their departure]: namely, bamboo and
cowhide for making parapets, small boats for use in shallow water; rice
for the crew; spears such as the Indians use, and certain shields or
bucklers which are called <i>car&agrave;zas</i>, in order to <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>make use of
them in default of the firearms. He was provided with all that he asked
immediately. After these arrangements were made, the father prior
advised the general, notwithstanding the forced delay of the army as it
was coming overland, to go immediately with his fleet to the port of
Su&agrave;l; for although he could not begin operations until the
arrival of Esteyb&agrave;r, yet his appearance with his vessels in
Pangasin&agrave;n in sight of Lingay&egrave;n, would be of great use in
terrifying the rebels, and in encouraging the loyal.</p>

<p>24. The general did so, and although the prior desired to accompany
the fleet, the former would not consent, alleging as a reason therefor
that since Bolin&agrave;o was so important a post, its conservation was
considered necessary, and the presence of the father religious was
inevitable for that, and also to provide the fleet with necessities in
the accidents of war. On that ever propitious and sacred day of the
Epiphany, after mass had been said, which was celebrated in the
flagship by the father prior, the fleet left the port of
Bolin&agrave;o. At five in the afternoon it came within sight of
Lingay&egrave;n, to the joy of the religious of St. Dominic, who had
retired there from almost all of Pangasin&agrave;n, as it was the least
exposed place. Until that moment they had been besieged by constant
frights. The general did not dare to go ashore, as many crowds of
people were seen on the beach, who appeared to be hostile; as well as
because he had yet no news of the army, without which he had orders not
to do anything, and he had no forces for that. On that account the
fleet kept tacking to windward on one tack and another for the space of
three days. But at the end of that time, a felucca was seen to <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>cross the bar
of Lingay&egrave;n headed toward the flagship. The father vicar of the
said village came aboard and informed the general that the Indians of
that district, although they had risen, were maintained in their
insurrection with great difficulty, and that without making pacts or
contracts, desired to surrender to the piety of the king, according to
the arrangements that he had already discussed with the chiefs.
Consequently, in his opinion, the men could disembark without the
slightest fear.</p>

<p>25. A council of war was called to discuss the matter. The said
father vicar, and the father chaplain, Fray Bernardino de la
Concepcion, were given a vote with the others, as was right. All were
of the opinion that the general should land with all his soldiers in
order that he might place himself in a position of defense for whatever
might happen. But that was unnecessary, for the Indians received him
with the greatest proofs of surrender, and from that time the village
of Lingay&egrave;n, which is the capital of the province, was one of
the most safe villages. The rebels who were there fled, as they were
fearful of punishment. But at that same time, the sedition was very
much alive in the rest of the province; for M&agrave;long treated those
who refused obedience to him with the utmost rigor unless they had
forces with which to resist him. This rigor was seen in his native
place Binalat&ograve;ngan, which he reduced to ashes, and allowed his
soldiers to sack, as the Indians fearful of the Spaniards opposed his
purposes. In Il&ograve;cos and Cagay&agrave;n, the provinces lying next
to Pangasin&agrave;n, was another Indian Don Juan Manz&agrave;no, who
acted as M&agrave;long&rsquo;s agent, and who was general of his
armies. He burned villages, killed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82"
href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>Indians, and reduced everything to the most
fatal pass, because he claimed that they denied obedience to our
king.</p>

<p>26. On that account, Ugalde knew that the sword would be necessary
in order to cut the gordian knot of so obstinate an insurrection. He,
believing that since the Zambals were so valiant and were especially
experienced in the mountains, where the rebels had their haunts, they
could be of great use to the army, wrote the father prior of
Bolin&agrave;o to procure a goodly levy of them, and send them out as
soldiers, with the assurance that he would give them help. That famous
hero went through the villages of Zamb&agrave;les with the greatest
diligence, and collected about three hundred of the most faithful,
valiant, and well-intentioned Indians. They, furnished with their
accustomed arms, and the above-mentioned Don Antonio D&agrave;cap,
being appointed master-of-camp with the necessary captains (whose
titles the general confirmed, as did afterward the governor, as a
payment for their good services) were despatched to Lingay&egrave;n,
where they arrived on the eighteenth of January. And in order that the
joy of the fleet might be complete, on the afternoon of that same day,
the desired news was received that the army of Esteyb&agrave;r had
entered the district of Pangasin&agrave;n without having met any
considerable disaster in its difficult march. Thereupon, Ugalde
arranged his troops, in order to go to join him. When the two armies
were united they began to work together. They attacked M&agrave;long
first, and after several engagements, the traitor was obliged to retire
together with those who remained of his men, to certain inaccessible
mountains, where they imagined that they would be safe. <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>But here the valor
of the Zambals shone forth, for directed by father Fray Bernardino who
never deserted them, they pursued the rebels through crag and thicket,
so that they compelled them, defiling gradually one after the other, to
surrender. Finally M&agrave;long himself fell into an ambush which was
boldly set for him, and he was seized on February 6 whereupon the
Pangasin&agrave;n war ended.</p>

<p>27. But in order not to leave this matter without conclusion, we
must add that our army, immediately increased by some companies of
Pangasinans (a nation that declared itself entirely favorable to the
Spaniards as soon as M&agrave;long was defeated), resolved after
holding a council of war to go immediately to Il&ograve;cos for the
purpose of destroying Manzano. But he with few men because many had
been lost in several frays, retired to some desolate places where he
built a fort. Our captains attacked him, however, full in front, and
inspired by their example the soldiers and Indians, and conquered him.
Many of the enemy were slaughtered, and we on our side did not fail to
lose many, because the resistance was especially obstinate. Manzano
escaped thence with some few of his men, and hid in certain mountains,
but the Zambals, Pangasinans, and Cagayans pursued him, and finally,
the justice of our arms prevailed. For, in order that no spark might be
left which might kindle a new fire, he was also seized on March 22.
Thus was that difficult war ended, which had caused Manila many
terrors, for it caused not a few fears to the Spaniards. Thereupon, the
provinces continued to become pacified. The governor Don Sabiniano, in
obedience to the action of the royal Audiencia, despatched a
commissary-general of causes, so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84"
href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>that, forming a tribunal together with
Esteyb&agrave;r, Ugalde, and other necessary ministers, he might make a
process in regard to those who had been most active among the rebels;
and after giving such persons the necessary punishment, publish a
general pardon, which would comprehend the remainder. It was reported
then that the judges proceeded with too great rigor, but I should not
be so bold as to impute that guilt to them, for they aimed to spread a
warning, without it ceasing to be very necessary.</p>

<p>28. The least thing that was seen in the disorders of so unjust a
rebellion was the deaths that were caused, notwithstanding that they
were numerous. There was seen vengeance clothed with zeal; ambition
usurping the staff of justice; tyranny proclaiming liberty; treason
applauded with adoration; and he who never knew the law of reason,
making laws. There were seen thefts, conflagrations, profanations of
the temples, persecutions, scorn, and the evangelical ministers killed
sacrilegiously; the Catholic religion abandoned in great part; and the
door opened to apostasy and infidelity. For what time, then, is the
purpose of inexorable justice, if it is not applied at such a time?
That was no sickness that could be cured by mild means when only iron
and fire were found capable of re&euml;stablishing that vast body in
health, rigor exercised there being a preservative medicine for the
rest. And if, perchance, any innocent one paid what he did not owe, one
must reflect that public vengeance was inflicted by the hands of men,
who, although they try to work with equity, are after all only men, and
that they would cease to be men, if they proceeded without the least
defect in all things. At last among many others who suffered <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>the last
punishment, M&agrave;long was shot in Lingay&egrave;n, Cauc&agrave;o
hanged in Binalat&ograve;ngan, Sum&ugrave;lay in Bolin&agrave;o,
S&igrave;rray in Masingloc, D&ugrave;rrey in Agno, and Manz&agrave;no,
in the village of Bac&agrave;rra, killed himself in order to escape the
hand of the hangman. But if some of them left the marks of treason in
the Zambal nation, which is ever valiant and loyal to the king, most of
them in number and rank, washed away that stain more than clean.
Everything yielded the great praise to the discalced Augustinians, who
were able, by their exhortations, to restrain and maintain the loyalty
of so many Indians of their districts, despising for that purpose many
perils.</p>

<h5 class="normal">&sect; IV</h5>

<p><i>Relation of the insurrection of the Sangleys or Chinese and how
our religious aided in bringing about peace and victory.</i></p>

<p>29. Outside the walls of the city of Manila, under the cannon of the
plaza, there is a very thickly populated settlement called the
Pari&eacute;n, where a large number of Chinese live. Those people are
known there under the name of Sangleys. Although heathen they have been
allowed to reside there for the sake of commerce and because they are
employed in almost all the mechanical trades. It cannot be denied that
that nation fomented and maintained with aid and cunning the rebellions
of the Indians which we have just related. That is apparent, because,
when the alcalde-mayor Don Francisco Pulido was killed in
Pangasin&agrave;n, some Sangleys were found among the rebels, who
contrived that under cover of the small boats they might capture the
large vessel where the alcalde-mayor was defending his <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>life very gallantly;
and on the arrival of our naval fleet to explore the beach of
Lingay&egrave;n, there were seen there many armed men, consisting of
Sangleys and Indians, as is affirmed by Father Santa Cruz, in volume 2
of his Dominican history of the Philipinas.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e710src" href="#xd0e710">2</a> But it is still more fully shown by
the many bodies of Sangleys which were found in the field whenever
there was an engagement with the rebels, for on all occasions they
served the Indians as auxiliaries. Let us examine the motive for the
Chinese taking part in a war that concerned them so little.</p>

<p>[Here follows a brief description of China and an account of the
victories of the Tartars about this time, the alliance of the pirate
Kuesing with the legitimate Chinese king Junglie, and following the
latter&rsquo;s death, the retreat of the pirate to Formosa whence he
expels the Dutch. His design to make the conquest is also related, and
his embassy by Father Victorio Riccio to Manila, demanding
&ldquo;prompt vassalage, and a huge tribute from the islands, and
threatening the most bloody war if Spaniards and Indians did not obey
this obligation and recognize him as king.&rdquo; The Chinese in
Manila, hating the Tartars and favorable to Kuesing, begin to raise
disturbances. Their anger is also further aroused by a commercial
treaty between the Spaniards and the Tartar emperor of China. But
little attention is paid to the Chinese of the Pari&aacute;n, however,
but both interior and exterior fortifications are strengthened and
constructed in case of an attack by Kuesing. The narrative continues:]
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87">87</a>]</span></p>

<p>34. For this purpose some scaffolds were built outside the wall so
that the pioneers might work comfortably. This, which was a means for
fortification, might, had not the divine aid intervened, have been the
cause of the loss of the city, the center of the faith in Assia and a
firm column of the Catholic religion. For the Sangleys determined with
the utmost secrecy not to let the opportunity slip, but, on the
contrary, to seize time by the forelock, and to climb in great numbers
by night by means of those scaffolds which were not guarded in
proportion to the danger. They thought that if they did so, and first
gained the wall by an unexpected and furtive rush they could obtain the
mastery of the city immediately without any opposition. In fact they
would have planned well had it not been that God tied their hands. It
happened, then, that the father sacristan of our convent going down one
morning to arrange the altar of the Santo Ecce Homo (an image of which
mention was made in volume iii,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e721src" href= 
"#xd0e721">3</a> as well as the great devotion that Governor Don
Sabiniano had for it), found at its divine feet a message reading as
follows: &ldquo;Governor, guard thy city, for they are trying to take
thee by surprise.&rdquo; The sacristan immediately put that message
into the hands of the father prior. The latter, considering that no one
had to hide himself in order to give such advice, (for, if it were
true, any person would be assured of a not small reward), he formed the
concept that that notice came from the hand of God; and above all that
it would be well to inform the governor of it. <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>For where there are so many
enemies, the most careful watch is none too much.</p>

<p>35. Consequently, he took the message to the governor, to whom he
told the manner in which he had found it. The prudent superior not only
esteemed the caution, but he doubled his care and vigilance by visiting
the walls and sentinels hourly. But on the morning of the following
day, another more detailed paper was found in the same place, which
read as follows: &ldquo;Governor, guard thy city. Remove the
scaffoldings from the walls, and do not trust anyone, for the enemy are
very near thee.&rdquo; The father prior also took that message to the
governor, alleging that because of his quality as a good vassal, he
could not avoid giving him that annoyance. But the governor was not
annoyed but instead thanked him again and again, and in his presence
had an adjutant, one Don Joseph Zamora, summoned, and ordered the
latter to remove the scaffolding of the walls, and double the guards in
all the posts. It was afterwards learned how important the arrangement
that has been practiced had been, for it was discovered when the
deserved punishment was meted out to the insurgents that the surprise
of the city was to have been attempted on the night following that day,
but that they had not succeeded because what was to have served them as
a ladder had been removed.</p>

<p>36. The Sangleys seeing the destruction of their designs, resolved,
at the beginning of the year 1662, to arm suddenly one day, with the
weapons which came first to hand, and to take the city openly, for they
trusted too much to their valor. There is a gate in the city called the
gate of the Pari&aacute;n, which gives <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb89" href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>on the Sangley settlement, and
innumerable numbers of that nation enter the city through it hourly.
They would find it easy if some of them were to make themselves masters
of this gate, for the others to enter the city armed. By a special
Providence of God, as brother Fray Diego de Santa Ana, one of our
religious lay-brothers, went to adjust an account with a certain
Sangley, on the morning of the day on which they had resolved to make
the attack, he observed that the Chinese were in great disorder, and he
even heard some words indicative of arrogance, and that they were
premeditating some sedition. The brother understood the Chinese
language somewhat, and having conceived the said suspicion, he went
about the Pari&aacute;n carefully and joined in conversation cunningly
with several Sangley acquaintances. By that means originated the
confirmation of his fears. He advised a captain of everything, who took
him into the presence of the governor so that he might inform the
latter. Upon receiving that information, the guards of the gates and of
the walls were doubled without any confusion, and most opportune orders
were given secretly for the artillerymen and soldiers to be prepared to
resist any attack.</p>

<p>37. Scarce six o&rsquo;clock could have struck, when the Sangleys
advanced to the gate of the city in a confused mass, with such violence
that doubtless they would have gained it, had our men not been so
prepared for its defense. With the regular discharge of the artillery,
and with the muskets of the guards, many of them were killed. At that
misfortune the others retired as furiously as they had begun the
attack. But honoring our discalced religious greatly <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>the governor was
wont to say whenever he saw brother Fray Diego, that next to the
patronage of the Santo Ecce Homo, the defense of the city was due to
his opportune advice. The enemy having been repulsed in this manner, a
portion of them, about two thousand, threw themselves into the river in
order to cross it. About three hundred of them having perished there,
the others fled to the mountains. As they passed it, they left our
convent and church of San Sebastian reduced to ashes. Its building had
been finished but a short time before, as it had been burned during
another insurrection. It could not but cause time and trouble to reduce
those rebels, but it was accomplished at last although accompanied with
the shedding of much blood. They were pursued on one side by the
Pampango Indians and on the other by the Zambals, who were led and
captained by our religious. The remaining Sangleys, who reached the
number of ten thousand, took their stand on the field in front of the
walls, thus causing not a little anxiety to Manila. But they were so
disposed that, anticipating a general pardon, conceded by the governor,
with the exception of some few leaders, before nightfall they were all
subdued, and that troubled sea was totally calm.</p>

<p>38. Father Palanco,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e741src" href=
"#xd0e741">4</a> a Dominican, declared very truly in the memorial which
he presented to the king, on that rebellion of the Sangleys,
&ldquo;that all the Orders worked and aided with singular vigilance on
that occasion exposing their lives to the service of both
Majesties.&rdquo; For the individuals of all the orders <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>endeavored to excel,
as ever, in their zeal and deeds, now by taking arms to go to the
defense of the walls, just as the most ordinary soldier might do; now
imploring divine clemency with supplications and prayers; and anon
assisting with advice and information. But there is no doubt that, as
is inferred from the abovesaid, our Recollects had a great share in
that victory, and that they shared considerably in the dangers of the
war. Thus are they able without failing in their obligations as
evangelical ministers, to serve their earthly king on all occasions, as
professors of both militias.</p>

class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>that field was
abandoned afterwards for lack of evangelical ministers, there is no
reason why endeavors so meritorious should be forgotten. Let our pen,
therefore, be busied in the relation of these labors.</p>

<p>66. The island of Luz&ograve;n, which is the largest and chiefest of
the Philipinas, has the appearance of an arm somewhat bent, according
to the description of father Fray Juan Francisco de San Antonio.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e784src" href="#xd0e784">5</a> It has a
circumference of more than four hundred Spanish leguas, and lies
between twelve and nineteen degrees of latitude. Not far from the point
of San Tiago, which we shall pretend to be the elbow of this arm,
journeying thence toward cape Bogeador, lies the great bay of Manila,
in the center of which this city is located. It is the capital of all
the possessions of the Spanish scepter in these islands. Lapping the
walls of Manila is a large river which empties at that place into the
sea. By it one ascends to the Lake of Bay, and on the opposite shore of
that lake one finds the village of Sinil&ograve;an. Thence to the port
of Lamp&ograve;n, which is located on the Contracosta of Manila, and
comes to be as it were, inside of the arm, one need only pass the
mountains of Dara&egrave;tan, and Cab&ograve;an, which is a crossing of
five or six leguas. Consequently, in order to go by sea from Manila to
the port of Lamp&ograve;n, one must sail about one hundred and forty
leguas; but by ascending the river and crossing over the lake to
Sinil&ograve;an, and crossing the mountains of Dara&egrave;tan and
Cab&ograve;an there is scarce twenty leguas of distance.</p>

<p>67. In the environs, then, of the port of Lamp&ograve;n, <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>following the
coast opposite the bay of Manila, are the districts of
Binang&ograve;nan, Bal&egrave;r, Casig&ugrave;ran, and Pal&agrave;nan
composed of various villages and collections of huts. The first three
belonged at first to the alcaldeship or province of Mind&ograve;ro.
Since in the year 1588, the discalced Franciscan fathers Fray Estevan
Ortiz and Fray Juan de P&ograve;rras were destined to that
jurisdiction, they gathered most seasonable fruits in the
above-mentioned districts, having sown there the seed of the Catholic
name. However, having been called to other parts by their obedience,
they could not further the Church in those districts, much as they
desired it. The venerable martyr, Fray Francisco de Santa Maria,
completed the perfection of the work, by forming the three
above-mentioned missions with a sufficient number of the faithful who
were withdrawn from the darkness of paganism by the influences of a
zeal so seraphic. Afterwards other workers of the same family extended
their missions down the beach toward the province of Cagay&agrave;n or
Nueva Segovia, and founded the village and district of Pal&agrave;nan.
With that there were four missions situated on that Contracosta, and
the Franciscan province kept the administration of them in their own
hands for many years. They hoped that, although there were but few
people and conveniences, as the mountains which were peopled by pagans
were near by, they could continue ever to increase the flock of Christ,
as they did do without ceasing, the sword of the evangelical preaching
fencing with the advantage gained by repeated triumphs.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e794src" href="#xd0e794">6</a></p>

<p>68. But since in this time with which the history <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>is concerned, the
boat of the above-mentioned province found itself with a great quantity
of fish in its nets, and with few fishers in its number for the support
of the work, they called to their aid the individuals of our holy
province. Nothing more than a sign was necessary to make them hasten
thither, expressing their thanks for the opportunity. Although I have
been unable to ascertain the year with certainty, I have foundation for
the conjecture that in the chapter celebrated in the year 1662, the
Franciscan fathers invited our Recollect family to take the
above-mentioned missions of the Contracosta. They alleged that they
were unable to attend to so many villages, whose care devolved upon
them, because of the lack of religious. They promised to cede those
missions to the Recollects, and not to retain any right of reversion.
Those missions were not very desirable, both because of the
wretchedness of the earth, and because of the small number of tributes
that they contained. For, although they had increased greatly with the
new conversions, they only contained 4,800 Christian souls in the year
1738, as was asserted by the historian of that seraphic province.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e804src" href="#xd0e804">7</a> But our Recollect
order has obtained a writ which was gained in Philipinas to occupy the
least profitable posts so far as earth is concerned, but the most
meritorious in the heavens. Consequently, those zealous fathers
received that work immediately, and forthwith assigned evangelical
ministers to cultivate the new vineyard, increasing the rational vines
in it with the care and zeal which the seraphic workers had managed to
exert thitherto. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href=
"#pb96">96</a>]</span></p>

<p>69. In consequence of this, the province chose father Fray Benito de
San Joseph, Fray Francisco de San Joseph, and Fray Clemente de San
Nicol&agrave;s, with three others whose names we have been unable to
discover. They took formal charge of the districts and founded the
following convents. Near the bay and port of Lamp&ograve;n, somewhat
inland toward the mountain, is located the village of
Binang&ograve;nan, and there the first house and church was established
with the title of San Guillermo. Two religious were left there. The
Tag&aacute;log language is spoken in that territory, although it
belongs to the province of Tay&agrave;bas and to the bishopric of
Camar&igrave;nes, or as it is called, Nueva C&agrave;ceres. The
ministers assigned to that village attended to various scattered
collections of huts along the bays of Lamp&ograve;n and Umir&egrave;y,
as well as to the reduction of the infidels which extends along the
neighboring mountains for the distance of twelve or fourteen leguas.
Going thence following the coast to the north, one meets the river and
village of Val&egrave;r. Another convent was founded there, titular and
patron of which was St. Nicholas of Tolentino. It belongs to the same
language, province, and bishopric, as the other. Only one religious was
stationed there, although afterward, according to the times, two lived
there. They tended to the mission which was very laborious because of
its size, and labored in the conversion of the Aetas, heathen of the
neighboring mountains, which allow passage from Val&egrave;r to the
province of Pamp&agrave;nga through the territory of Patab&agrave;ngan
and Sant&ograve;r, by a not long, but very rough road.</p>

<p>70. Sailing along the same coast toward Cape Enga&ntilde;o one comes
to the bay of Casig&ugrave;ran, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb97" href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>has a circumference of twelve leguas.
On its shore is located the village of the same name. The third convent
was erected there and was given the title of our father St. Augustine.
It belongs also to the Tag&aacute;log language, the province of
Tay&agrave;bas, and the bishopric of Camar&igrave;nes. Two religious
resided there generally, and sometimes three, for they extended their
administration to many leguas of coast, and their zeal for the spread
of the faith to the extensive mountains near by, which being filled
with A&egrave;tas, blacks, and Cal&igrave;ngas heathen gave worthy
although most toilsome occupation to the messengers of the law of
grace. From one extremity of the bay of Casig&ugrave;ran, the point
called San Ildephonso protrudes three leguas seaward. At its head end
the province of Tay&agrave;bas and the bishopric of Camar&igrave;nes.
Having doubled that point, and after one has navigated ten or twelve
leguas northward one comes to the village and district of
Pal&agrave;nan, which belongs to the bishopric and province of
Cagay&agrave;n or Nueva Segovia. The fourth convent is founded there,
and bears the title of Santa Maria Magdalena. And although all the
religious who could be assigned to that mission illumined it,
considering the lack of them from which this holy province usually
suffers, yet notwithstanding this, it could always be said that the
harvest was great and the laborers few. For besides the Christians
already reduced, the fathers had to contend with an innumerable number
of heathen who overran the neighboring mountains for a distance of more
than thirty leguas from the point of San Ildephonso to Cape
Enga&ntilde;o.</p>

<p>71. I assert that I have several times heard from fathers Fray
Valero de San Salvador and Fray Silvestre <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb98" href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>de la Purificacion (who passed a
considerable portion of their well-employed lives in those missions,
and whom I knew in Manila, and who attained a venerable and exemplary
age) that from the admission of that territory by our province to the
year 1704, the multitude of infidels who were turned by the preaching
of our brothers from the unhappy liberty of paganism to the mild yoke
of the Catholic faith, was vast. For, notwithstanding that there were
three or four epidemics in all those villages in the above-named
period, which occasioned the death of an excessive portion of the old
Christians, the settlements were replaced by those newly converted.
Consequently, the lack was not observed, for the same number of
tributes were collected for the king during the latter years as during
the first. This same thing is attested by the documents and depositions
that I have before me, which designate the Recollect religious who
lived on the Contracosta with the character of laborers in the living
missions because of the many souls that their apostolic zeal drew to
the sheepfold of the Church.</p>

<p>72. But notwithstanding that, the fruit must have caused entire
consolation as it was so visible, and given greater earnestness to
continue. That fatal interruption of missions in which no workers of
our Recollect family passed to Philipinas from Espa&ntilde;a from the
year 1692 to that of 1710, having occurred, the province found it
impossible to give, as it had done hitherto six or eight religious for
those missions because their exhaustion made them needed for other
missions. Although our brothers were more than men in their zeal, in
material work they could do nothing more than men. Therefore, it was
impossible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href=
"#pb99">99</a>]</span>to look after so great an employ as they had in
their charge, since they had so few subjects. And already it is seen
that if necessity obliged them to abandon any district, it must be that
of the Contracosta. They did not regard that as a conquest proper, but
as received in trust. It was so, for in the provincial chapter held in
the year 1704, after that apostolic province had possessed those
doctrinas and convents for more than forty years, it was resolved to
abandon them all, and return them to their first masters, the religious
of St. Francis, as they could not attend to their administration. Those
seraphic workers, learning the reason; took new charge of those souls
in order to attend to them with the bread of the instruction. On this
account, the above-mentioned convents do not now belong to the order,
and the villages of the Contracosta are not in our charge. But the
narration of the so plausible readinesss practiced by our oldtime
heroes has been deemed indispensable. In due time, namely, the year
1703, when the prodigious life of the venerable mantelata<a class= 
"noteref" id="xd0e822src" href="#xd0e822">8</a> Juana de Jesus, whose
virtue sprang from the teaching of our religious, is related, one will
see that with that fruit alone all their evangelical attempts can be
considered as well employed.</p>

<p>[The second and last section of this chapter deals with the life of
Fray Agustin de San Ildephonso, who died in the convent of Toboso,
Spain, during this year 1662. He was never in the Philippines.]</p>

<p>[Section i of chapter iii treats of the seventh general chapter of
the order, which was held in Alcal&aacute; de Henares in 1663. Sections
ii and iii narrate the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href=
"#pb100">100</a>]</span>life of Fray Juan de San Antonio, an
ex-provincial of the Philippines. Born of a noble family in Granada, he
early showed great precocity and attained proficiency in his studies
while very young. Being strongly called to the religious life he
entered the Recollect convent at Granada, September 13, 1617, at the
age of twenty and professed the following year. After a short course in
theology he went to Mexico in 1619, whence after another course in
theology in that city he was sent to Manila, where he was ordained
priest after a third theological course, in 1621. The following year
found him master of novitiates in Manila convent. Although his parents
obtained permission for him to return to Spain, in 1624, he preferred
to remain in the field which he had chosen. That same year he was prior
of the convent of Igaquet and was later occupied in many missions,
especially in Calamianes. In 1635 he was elected definitor, and
desirous of preaching the gospel in Japan, made two attempts to
penetrate that empire, both of which were failures, the second time
sickness not even allowing him to leave the Philippines. He was elected
prior of Manila convent in 1638 and after his three years&rsquo; term
worked again in the missions of Calamianes and composed two hooks in
the language of that district, one of moral sermons and the other an
explanation of the catechism. In 1644 he was elected provincial almost
by acclamation. His term was a busy one, and a number of churches and
convents were erected during it. During the disastrous earthquake of
1645, he rendered distinct service. He began the repair of the
Recollect church and convent of Manila, which had been partially
destroyed by the earthquake. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href= 
"#pb101">101</a>]</span>At the end of his term he retired to his cell
in Manila, but became implicated in some way with the civil-religious
troubles that rose during the governorship of Diego Faxardo, and he was
arrested in 1651 and sent to Marivelez. With the change of government,
he returned to Manila, and then retired to the Cavite convent, where he
died from an illness in January 1663. He was pure minded and austere in
his devotions. The fourth and last section of this chapter narrates the
life of a Recollect who died in 1663 at the convent of Zaragoza,
Spain.]</p>

<p>[Chapter iii recounts the lives of three Recollect religious who
died in the year 1664, only the first of whom was in the Philippines.
This was Fray Joseph de la Anunciacion, and his life is discussed in
the first two sections. He was born in Madrid and took the Recollect
habit in that city, October 8, 1615. He was chosen for the Philippine
missions and arrived at Manila in 1623. Most of his work in the islands
was as Spanish preacher, and his work lay principally in the convents
of Manila, San Juan, San Sebastian, Cavite, and Ceb&uacute;. He did
considerable work among the native Filipinos, the Chinese, mestizos,
negroes, and mulattoes, ever in the Spanish language, but he was able
to adapt himself well to their degree of intelligence. His preaching
was especially effective in the city of Ceb&uacute; which was more
densely populated in his time than a century later. His influence was
far reaching among all classes. Twice he was elected provincial of his
order&mdash;April 8, 1635, and May 7, 1650. His terms were active and
productive of good work. Recollects began their work in the island of
Romblon under his directions, and he attempted to send missionaries
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>to
Japan. During his term also Recollects were successful in pacifying
many disaffected districts. His death occurred in the Ceb&uacute;
convent of which he was prior at the time.]</p>

<p><i>Treating of the hardships endured by our religious in Philipinas,
because of various persecutions that occurred in our fields of
Christendom.</i></p>

<p><i>The year 1668</i></p>

<div class="div4">
<h5 class="normal">&sect; I</h5>

<p><i>Abridged relation of the persecutions of our holy faith in
Philipinas, from the year 1640 to the year under consideration, 1668,
and which are not mentioned in the preceding volumes.</i></p>

<p>307. He who would like to know what manner of province is ours in
Philipinas and its height of love to God and its neighbor, which that
Lord has given to it, who is so well able to inculcate charity, must
not be governed only by the immense zeal of its individuals in alluring
souls into the sheepfold of the Church but as well by the continual
persecutions which they have suffered in order that they might maintain
that field of Christendom in the purity of the faith, despising their
lives at each step in order to preserve it. The lack of fear of death,
by which those valiant soldiers of the God of armies have sustained the
field of battle against all the power of the gates of hell, is
doubtless one of the greatest of miracles which divine Providence has
hung in its temple in this world, to the no small glory of these
provinces of Espa&ntilde;a, that have become such marvels of charity
through so good milk, that they consider <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb103" href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>and have considered it an honor to
suffer and even to die, in order to defend that harassed church. Many
events in confirmation of this truth are drawn With most accurate brush
in the preceding volumes of this history. By them one may see that our
brothers have left us examples worthy of imitation by incessantly
placing in practice the highest perfection of exposing their lives to
death for the assistance and consolation of certain poor Indians, that
they might encourage them in the continual invasions of the Moros. But
notwithstanding the great skill that accompanied the painters of so
idealistic canvasses, I find in a lower degree not a few pictures
worthy of immortality, for without doubt the colors of the notices were
lacking, which are so indispensable to form the pictures in the
painting of history. I having obtained trustworthy relations of the
many misfortunes that assaulted our fields of Christendom and their
directors from the year 1640 until the present of 1668, which is under
consideration, it would not be laudable to leave such trophies buried
in forgetfulness, although the copy, which would have been most
accurate if done by the brushes of the other writers, be
disfigured.</p>

<p>308. To continue; Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcu&egrave;ra, governor
of Philipinas, thought that by building and garrisoning some
strongholds in Tol&ograve; [<i>i.e.</i>, Jol&oacute;], an island which
is given over to the perfidy of Mahomet and is the nesting place of the
robbers of the whole archipelago, he could restrain its inhabitants by
preventing them from going to our villages with their fleets as they
had done until that time, with the sequel of innumerable depredations.
He put that idea into practice in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb104" href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>year 1638, after the conclusion of
the war with the koran, in the beginning of which when the sword was
drawn the scabbard was thrown away. But neither his valor nor that
diligence were sufficient for the attainment of his end. For in the
year 1640, now by the Joloans themselves, and now by means of the
Borneans their allies, and now by making use of their vassals who
inhabited the adjacent islands, they tried to find in sea surprises
some betterment of their fortune or some havoc by which to temper it.
With that object they attacked missions belonging to our reformed order
both boldly and treacherously in the districts of Calami&agrave;nes,
Butu&agrave;n, and Cagayang; and it is a fact that we always had the
worst of it in those wars. They committed depredations very much to
their liking, with the boldness that their greed gave them and with the
severity which their hatred to the evangelical law inspired in them.
The captives who were taken in our villages on that occasion numbered
three hundred and more. The churches were ruined, the holy images
profaned, the evangelical ministers became fugitives in the mountains,
the sheep were scattered as their shepherds could not attend to them
with their watchful eye, the villages were reduced to ashes, and all of
those fields of Christendom became the necessary object of the most
bitter lamentation.</p>

<p>309. They did almost the same thing in the three following years,
and there was no means of taking worthy satisfaction from enemies so
inhuman who, like wild and hellish beasts, destroyed a great portion of
the rich patrimony of Christ which had flourished in that country under
the care of our discalced order. The devastation was so general that it
appears to have been presaged by heaven with very extraordinary <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>portents.
For on the fourth day of January, 1640, a volcano suddenly burst forth
in the island of Sanguiz, not far from the cape of San Agustin in the
island of Mindanao, which showed very rare and unusual results. For the
ashes, rocks, and burning material which it cast up traveled for many
leguas as far as Zeb&ugrave;. Noises like artillery were heard, which
caused the Spanish garrisons to get under arms, and the day grew dark
from ten in the morning, so that it seemed pitch black night. The same
thing happened in another volcano in an islet opposite the bar of the
river of Jol&ograve;. There was a furious hurricane in the island of
Luz&ograve;n up toward the province of Il&ograve;cos in the part where
the Igol&ograve;tes live. That hurricane was followed by the most
frightful earthquake, and the earth swallowed up three inaccessible
mountains with as many settlements which were located at the foot of
the mountains, and in the space left a large lake was formed. Such was
the noise at the dislocation of the huge mass of those mountains, that
it was heard not only in all the Philipinas Islands and in
Mal&ugrave;co but also in the kingdoms of Cochinchina, China, and
Camb&ograve;ja, throughout a circumference of more than nine hundred
leguas. So great was the persecution that it was believed to have been
announced by the so great heaping together of surprises and
misfortunes.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e870src" href="#xd0e870">9</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106">106</a>]</span></p>

<p>310. But the time when the Moros gave full rein to their barbaric
fury, was from the beginning of the year 1645, for then they were freed
from the terror that had been caused them by Corcu&egrave;ra who had
just been succeeded in the government of the islands by the
master-of-camp Don Diego Fajardo. The arrival also of two ships well
manned with Dutchmen at Jol&ograve; and which had been asked for by
Prince Salic&agrave;la, the heir to the scepter, for the purpose of
destroying the strongholds which the Spaniards held in the said island,
gave them at that time a motive for employing greater power in their
piracies. Although the commandant of those strongholds, Don Estevan de
Orella Hugalde, caused the enemy to return to their factories badly the
losers, and without having obtained the end of their attempt, the
Joloans were able, through their protection, to launch three squadrons
which filled our villages with fear and confusion. It is no new thing
in that continent for the heretics to lend arms to the pagans and to
the Mahometans in order to put down the Christian name. A savage end it
is to pit themselves for the private ends of trade and in a religious
war, on the side of the koran and of idolatry, which they themselves
condemn, against the gospel, which they persecute with fury. The three
fleets went out then, for their campaign, and not having anyone to
oppose them, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href=
"#pb107">107</a>]</span>enemy filled their boats with what they called
spoils, took about two hundred captives, persecuted our religious as
ever, with mortal hate, and destroyed fifteen villages, almost all of
them of our spiritual administration, and they filled Calami&agrave;nes
especially with bitterness and grief.</p>

<p>311. The Dutch were not content with protecting the Moros, in order
that they might persecute the name of Christ, but they themselves tried
to drive that name from all that archipelago. Among all the disunited
members of the Spanish monarchy, which the Dutch have endeavored to cut
off from it, (in order that their power might wax more formidable at
the expense of another) they have ever cast their eyes on the honorable
and wealthy dominion of the Philipinas Islands. That country is such
for their designs and trade, that better could not be desired: both
because from there they were assured of all the trade of China,
Jap&ograve;n, Cochinchina, Camb&ograve;ja, and the Mal&ugrave;cas; and
because they were guaranteed the best woods for the building of their
ships that can be found on the whole round earth. For that reason, the
Dutch have left no stone unturned in all times if it pertained to the
maxim of their desire, as can be deduced from several passages which
are to be found in the previous decades and are necessary for the
intelligence of the history that is treated in them.<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e894src" href="#xd0e894">10</a> The year, then, of 1646, they
were seen with fifteen warships. With five of them they <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108">108</a>]</span>besieged the
district of Playah&ograve;nda, while seven of them were stationed in
the Embocadero or strait of San Bernardino, and the remaining three
filled the islands of the Pintados with fear. Our villages of
Mas&igrave;nloc, Iba, Mariv&egrave;lez, Rombl&ograve;n, Bant&ograve;n,
and Surig&agrave;o, suffered more harm and vexation than usual, of
which the greater part touched the religious ministers.</p>

<p>312. Two galleons left Cav&igrave;te and fought first with five
ships and twice afterwards with seven, and obtained three victories
which were clearly miraculous. For they destroyed the enemy, without
receiving any special damage, and the enemy were compelled to abandon
their attempts for the nonce. Although father Fray Balthassar de Santa
Cruz attributes all of the prodigy to Our Lady of the Rosary with
sufficient foundation,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e919src" href=
"#xd0e919">11</a> we, while confessing the might of so holy a warrior,
must suggest that St. Nicholas of Tolentino had no small part in it,
whom the soldiers, persuaded by two Recollects, as is mentioned in
volume 3 of this history, who served as chaplains in our small fleet,
also invoked as the sworn patron of those seas.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e925src" href="#xd0e925">12</a> But under shelter of the Dutch
enemy, who continued their attempts with no more success the two
following years, the Moros, always emboldened, transgressed all bounds,
attacking ceaselessly the villages of the Spanish dominion. For,
although Corral&agrave;t, king of Mindan&agrave;o, kept quiet during so
dangerous a season for reasons of his own convenience, and had even
acted as mediator so that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href= 
"#pb109">109</a>]</span>Butria B&ograve;ngso, king of Jol&ograve;
should make peace with our arms, which was done April 14, 1646, none of
all that was sufficient to give quiet to that field of Christendom.
Mahometan perfidy took the pretext that the Joloan Prince
Salic&agrave;la and Paguy&agrave;n Cachile, prince of the Guinbanos,<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e933src" href="#xd0e933">13</a> and seignior of
Tuptup in Born&egrave;y, should refuse to sign the peace. With that
excuse those princes, aided in secret by those kings, peopled the sea
with boats and caused unspeakable damage to Calami&agrave;nes,
Camigu&igrave;n, and Rombl&ograve;n.</p>

<p>313. That was not the only fatal consequence that followed from
those inhuman premises which were set by the Dutch. For if we had
thitherto seen the aliens fighting against the faith, from the year
1649 the very sons of the Church worked for its destruction. The Dutch
incited the Indians, already Christian and subject, to withdraw
themselves from the mild yoke of Spain, the country which had drawn
them from the darkness of paganism, and kept them on the road to
salvation. Nor were they deaf to the voices filled with the fraud most
difficult to recognize, for since they carried the agreeable sound of
liberty, they secretly induced them to undergo the most tyrannical
subjection; and God permitting by His secret judgments excessive
flights to audacity and shamelessness for the credit of the virtuous
and the crown of the just; the most cowardly of nations were seen with
surprise and the nakedness of the Indians was armed against the
invincible sword of the Spaniards. The insurrection began in the
village of Palap&agrave;g in the province of Hibab&agrave;o in the
island of S&agrave;mar, whence the good outcome of the first action
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href=
"#pb110">110</a>]</span>traveling on the wings of unsteady report,
found minds so ready throughout the islands of Pint&agrave;dos, that
(just as if the counsel were common, and they were only awaiting the
signal in order to do it), the temples were burned in many places, and
sacred things profaned. The evangelical ministers fled, and the rebels
retiring to the loftiest mountains, imagined that they could defend
their former barbarity there.</p>

<p>314. Our reformed order had enough things to bewail in those
revolutions; for in addition to the tragedies of Linao, which are
related in volume 3,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e945src" href=
"#xd0e945">14</a> the villages of Cagay&agrave;ng, Camiguin,
Hing&ograve;og, Rombl&ograve;n, Bant&ograve;n, and Cibuy&agrave;n added
wood to the fire of the sedition. If the promised help of the Dutch had
come over and above the boldness of the Indians, it is inferred that
what had taken so many years to conquer would have been lost in a few
days. But God who always punishes as a father those who try to serve
Him, measured the times so accurately, that amid the echoes of the
insurrection, the proclamations of the peace which had been arranged
between Espa&ntilde;a and Olanda resounded in Manila. With that the
Catholic arms were freed from their chastisement, and all things
returned to their pristine quiet. That was not the case with the Moros,
who were then and for many years after, the perennial enemies of that
afflicted field of Christianity. Barbarously blinded in their
treacherous gains as if it were a thing done, they made a practice of
going every year to take captives in the islands of our administration,
often outraging the temples sacrilegiously and not a single one that
was near the beach <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href=
"#pb111">111</a>]</span>escaped profanation and they utterly abused
everything intended for religious worship, with great scorn to the name
of Christian. They cut the sacred vestments, into robes and other
garments [<i>capisayos</i>], and they destined the ciboriums and sacred
chalices to the dirty use of their wine, tobacco, and buyo.</p>

<p>315. But it did not so happen, I return to say. For notwithstanding
that they were a terror every year from that of 1649 to 1655 because of
their piracies, now in some and now in other parts, they remained
without the due punishment although so sacrilegious insults demanded it
so justifiably. Without fear of our arms, they overran those seas at
will, trusting their security to their swiftness; for their boats were
built on purpose for piracy, and ours compared to theirs of lead. It
happened not once only that they were taken because of carelessness
between the bars of the rivers with forces sufficient to make one
consider their destruction sure; but they got out laughing on one side
or the other, amid the discharge of their artillery. And the forces of
Manila, Zeb&ugrave;, Zambo&agrave;ngan, and Carh&agrave;ga, which were
not despicable squadrons, served no other purpose than to scare off the
evil, so that the persecution might be enormously expanded. They
carried their insolence so far that two small vessels with but small
crews, dashed into the bay of Manila one of the above years, and almost
in sight of that capital, seized a caracoa from Iloilo with the rich
cargo aboard it. Then they went out haughtily, and no one could take
their prize from them, or punish their arrogance. In view of this one
may infer how harassed were the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112"
href="#pb112">112</a>]</span>distant villages, and how filled with
tribulations were our religious ministers, who ever occupied the most
advanced and dangerous posts.</p>

<p>316. It even transcended the tragic representation of so doleful
misfortunes, when in the year 1655 Corral&agrave;t, king of
Mindan&agrave;o, proclaimed war against the Christian name. He began
his treachery by the inhuman murders of two fathers of the Society whom
their rank as ambassadors, which is so greatly respected by the law of
nations, did not aid. That prince was in Philipinas what Gustavus
Adolphus, king of Suecia, was in Alemania, namely, the thunderbolt of
Lucifer, the scourge of Catholicism, and the Attila of the evangelical
ministers, who never practiced courtesy toward them except when force
or some reason of state compelled him so to do. For his private
convenience he had pretended that he was peaceful in public during the
preceding years. But now with no other reason than his fury, he gave
license to his vassals to infest the Christian villages; and they did
it like a river which overflows its bed, after having rid itself of the
embarrassment of its dikes. He was not content with that, but in order
to give greater flights to his impiety, he excused it among the
neighboring Moros under the name of a religious war; and under that
title he invited to it the Borneans, Tidorans, and Joloans, so that
confederated with him into one body they might unfurl the banners of
the perfidious Mahomet, without stopping until they utterly destroyed
the law of grace.</p>

<p>317. He incited so great an uprising against that straitened field
of Christendom that, although the previous persecutions that the Moros
had practiced <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href=
"#pb113">113</a>]</span>against it were so inhuman, (as may be seen in
the places of this history cited in the margin)<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e966src" href="#xd0e966">15</a> they were all assuredly less
intolerable than those which were now incited; for now fury and
barbarity were carried to the extreme. That was so fierce that
disinterested pens did not hesitate to compare it with the last of
antichrist; so persevering, that until the year 1668, of which this
history is treating, and the year when the relations which we follow
end, there was not a single instant of rest; so shameless that ruin was
seen almost at the very gates of Manila; and so universal that but few
villages of our administration escaped being the theater of war and the
lamentable object of its misfortunes. This is a brief compendium of the
tragic events which happened in the Philippine church, which was
surrounded on all sides by the waters of contradiction, as is the
territory of those islands by the salt waves of the sea. This is a
sketch of the cold winds, which, notwithstanding the heat of its
climate, parched in great part the wavy exuberance of that leafy
garden, so abounding in the flowers of Christianity and the mature
fruits of virtue. Let us now consider with the most possible brevity, a
concise sketch of the glory which was obtained by our discalced order
in return for the hardships which overwhelmed its evangelical workers
at so calamitous a time. We warn the reader that we shall follow no
other chronological order than chance offers. <span class="pagenum">[<a

<h5 class="normal">&sect; II</h5>

<p><i>Of the hardships of our religious during these persecutions. The
venerable father, Fray Antonio de San Agustin, dies at the hands of the
Moros, in glorious martyrdom.</i></p>

<p>318. In the above-mentioned pillaging,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e988src" href="#xd0e988">16</a> which God permitted for so many
years, the Moros were triumphant, the Catholic arms rebuffed, the
Christian villages without other defense than that of heaven, and the
Indians drowned in the sea of tribulations. Moreover, as the sword of
the persecutor, also that of greed and vengeance, was moved by the
hatred of our holy faith, the direction of its greatest force was
toward the sowers of the gospel. Daily did religious who had been
driven from their ministries and missions bring to Manila news of
entire villages ruined, the outcries of priests who had been captured,
and letters which announced the death of others. All was confusion, all
lamentation, all chaos, where the enemies of God were trying to elevate
their throne in the darkness upon so bloody and confused injustice. It
has already been seen that our Recollects had to suffer greatly, since
they occupy the vanguard of the army of God in Carh&agrave;ga and
Calamianes; but that was irremediable in so disastrous a storm. The
ship was seen to be buffeted hither and yon by the waves; and it was
impossible that the sailors should not suffer from the buffeting. The
winds were both violent and hostile; the ship could not but be dashed
from one side to another. The hurricane was both furious and fierce;
necessarily the pilots had to suffer greatly.</p>

<p>319. Our provincials called out for relief, exciting <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>pity by the
relation of their churches which had been burned and profaned; of their
sheep that had been scattered, and many of them lost; and by their
subjects who had been killed or captured, or at the least obliged to
hide in the mountains, where deprived of all necessity, they suffered
indescribable misery, traveling in the inconveniences and darkness of
the night in order to fulfil their obligation as missionaries. But
Manila is, as a rule, the place where least attention is paid to the
wretchedness of the poor Indians and to the misfortunes of the gospel
workers; for, since the citizens are busied in their Asiatic and
American trade, the only thing that troubles them is any opposition to
their profits. Very few are the Spaniards who risk themselves in small
boats to seek profit from island to island; and consequently, they hear
of misfortunes, which ought to cause the greatest horror, quietly and
without any special disturbance. The passages from some islands to
others being occupied and even embarrassed by Moro craft, the latter
cause those who sail thither innumerable ruin; but many of the
inhabitants of Manila have very little or, perhaps, no feeling. If news
arrives that a religious has been killed or captured, some insolent
tongue is not wanting to break out with the ballad as infamous as
ancient, that the king brings us for this, namely, to suffer and die in
defense of the law of God; as if it were compatible with the royal
piety to abandon the defenseless ministers of Christ, however much they
may expose themselves with heroic mind to endure a thousand martyrdoms.
Nothing in short, matters to those people, if it do not touch their
persons or interests: neither the misfortunes nor the violent deaths of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>their
neighbors, nor the outrages of his Majesty&rsquo;s vassals, nor the
losses of his royal treasury in the tributes which are lessened by such
confusions, because the Indians are lost by the thousand.</p>

<p>320. Although the captain-general tries, as a good minister, to
attend to such wrongs, it is quite common that he is unable to do all
that he tries; now because of the depletion of the royal treasury,
whose funds do not suffice to meet the calls upon it; and now since he
must proceed with the advice of the council of war in which those have
many votes who understand only what pertains to the exercise of
merchants, although they sign their names with military titles. If the
vessels in which they are interested are in danger, all difficulties
are conquered, for there is no one who does not hasten with vote and
money to fit out fleets to oppose the enemy. But if not then each
proposition is a labyrinth, whence he who makes it cannot unravel
himself, although Ariadne gives him a thread to guide him. Hence it
follows, either that squadrons are not prepared of size sufficient to
warn the aggressors, or if they are prepared, they set sail when it
would be better for them not to, for they only occasion the vassals new
trouble. Let no one imagine that the matter of these two numbers
includes imagination or lack of truth. This is proved by authentic
documents in what touches the past; while so far as the present century
is concerned (during which the same persecutions have been repeatedly
shown), experience has given me knowledge of such injuries, when I, as
procurator-general and secretary of the province of Philipinas, found
that I had to solicit relief for the persecuted Indians and for the
afflicted religious. It is also certain that <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb117" href="#pb117">117</a>]</span>the same thing happened in
almost all the wars of which we are speaking, so that our oppressed
missionaries had no other consolation than that of God, in the pains
that it was indispensable for them to suffer, and which we shall now
begin to relate.</p>

<p>321. We have already mentioned in various parts of this history,
that when our Recollects arrived at the Philipinas Islands, in order to
illumine them with the splendors of the faith, and to fight like
well-ordained astral bodies against the sissara of the abyss, they
chose with apostolic strength the most difficult districts, the islands
of the most barbaric people, and the places where, if the light of the
gospel had shone, it had allowed itself to be seen only in fitful
gleams. Hence it is that our ministers are the most exposed to peril
and danger among all those of the archipelago; for they are very
distant, not only from Manila, but also among themselves from one
another, and surrounded by enemies to the Christian name. Each district
consists of many villages and even of distinct islands. Since all of
them have a right to the bread of the doctrine, which is the only food
for souls, the religious, in order to attend to that obligation, has to
be in continual movement. He must travel by sea threatened by so many
dangers to his life, among frights and chance; and he who considers it
of value to endure them and despise them, can only form a just opinion
of them. They do this without other profit than the spiritual, enduring
to the uttermost penury, and the lack of necessities, in order to teach
and instruct certain poor peoples whom they are alluring from the most
wild barbarism in order to get them to live like men in a civilized
Christian society. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href=
"#pb118">118</a>]</span></p>

<p>321. Let one add to all the above bodily hardships the lack of one
to employ himself in so great charity, to whatever serves in this life
as a consolation to the spirit. For there our religious is properly a
hermit, although he may live among many people. Now, it is because he
is deprived of the company of his brothers, for he is almost always
alone in villages that are too large, and the nearest minister is
fifteen or twenty leguas away and separated by rough seas, or
inaccessible mountains, which render it impossible most of the year for
them to have the comfort of seeing one another, or even to have
communication with one another by means of letters, in order that they
might console one another in their mutual troubles. Now, it is because
the Indians make them no company for the blessings that human
association brings with it, but serve only for an insupportable
martyrdom; for, in addition to the fatigues incumbent on them as
missionaries, they must attend to all their quarrels, grudges,
necessities, and troubles. For these reasons and others that cannot be
expressed at present, the governor of Philipinas, Don Fausto
Cruz&agrave;t y G&ograve;ngora, when addressing the king in a report,
did not hesitate to affirm that the discalced Augustinians, even in
times of peace, and after the subjection of the villages of their
administration, suffer the same hardships as do missionaries in the
lands of the infidels. His Excellency, the bishop of Zeb&ugrave;, Don
Manuel Antonio de Ocio y Ocampo, was wont to say, as I have heard from
his own mouth, and not only once, that if he had authority for it he
would not hesitate to canonize any Recollect, who happens to lose his
life among the fatigues of his calling, while completely fulfilling his
obligation in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href=
"#pb119">119</a>]</span>missions of those islands, as is the case with
many.</p>

<p>323. And if this is endured in only the hardships annexed to the
spiritual administration, what must it not be when the destructive
tempests of the persecutions of the Moros, the greatest part of which
assail our laborers, happen to come? Then there is no other relief than
to flee to the mountains in order to live in passes and caves, seeking
their preservation, not so much for their self-love, but because of
that for others. There, through lack of food, too much heat, continual
rains, and many other discomforts, they are generally so disfigured and
so weak that rivaling Job, they only live because of a skin loosely
stretched over their bones. How many contract incurable diseases there,
who dragging along all their life with them prove themselves to be
stages of the greatest pity! How many by trampling under foot evident
dangers, in hastening to the consolation of their sheep, to confess the
sick, to aid the dying, either gave themselves into the hands of the
enemy to be the victims of their cruelty, or offered themselves a
willing sacrifice to the precipices of the mountains and to the
shipwrecks of the seas! How many, since the world is unworthy of their
noble and Christian intercourse, and, it seems, tried to cast from
itself, wander for months at a time, naked, an hungered, persecuted,
followed on all sides by the shadow of death, without other consolation
than that of God, in whose hands they desire to finish their lives,
delivering to Him their wearied souls! And how many, finally, obtained
the precious crown of martyrdom, after having coursed the sands of so
many hardships, which were ended either by the edge of the sword, or by
a spear-thrust, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href=
"#pb120">120</a>]</span>or at the spindle of hardships, or at grief at
seeing holy things so outraged, or by the inundations of penalties in
atrocious captivities! Mention has been made of many in the preceding
volumes, but some who will serve to ornament this volume were
omitted.</p>

<p>[In the remainder of this section are contained accounts of several
who suffered the martyrdoms above mentioned in their war of the faith,
and all of whom are mentioned by Comb&eacute;s in his <i lang="es">
Historia de Mindanao</i>, who is cited at length by our author.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e1019src" href="#xd0e1019">17</a> The first
martyr (see Comb&eacute;s, book vi, chapter xiv) is not even named by
Comb&eacute;s, nor can Assis give anything more definite of him. He was
captured by the Moro pirates (presumably in 1645) and taken to their
home. Induced by desire for a good ransom, his captors took the father
to the Jol&oacute; fort, but no agreement could be reached. Father Juan
Contreras, then chaplain of the fort, tried to aid him in effecting his
escape, but in vain. The captive was thereafter treated so harshly that
he became ill, and in spite of a pitiable letter, which aroused great
sympathy for him in the Spanish Joloan fort, and spurred on the
soldiers to beg that he be ransomed at their expense, he remained in
captivity until Alejandro Lopez of the Society went to Jol&oacute; from
Zamboanga and ransomed him for 300 pesos. In 1649 (see Comb&eacute;s,
book vii, chapter xii; and Santa Theresa, no. 271 ff.), the father
prior of Linao in Caraga, Fray Agustin de Santa Maria, was killed by
the insurgents; and in the same troubles the <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb121" href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>father prior of Camiguin, whose
name is not given, was captured and maltreated. In 1658, (see
Comb&eacute;s, book viii, chapter viii), the Moros caused Fray
Cristobal de Santa Monica to flee, and killed Fray Antonio de las
Missas, or de San Agustin (his religious name). This latter happened
while San Agustin was returning from a trip to Cuyo and Calamianes as
visitor. San Agustin was born in Manila, his father being Captain
Francisco de las Missas, and his mother Fabiana de Villafanne, both
Spaniards. He took the Recollect habit July 14, 1612. He served in
several important posts, having as early as 1624 been prior of Bolinao
and of Ceb&uacute;. He was sixty-six years old at the time of his
death.]</p>

<p>[The remaining two sections of this chapter continue with the
persecutions of the Moros and the deaths of various Recollects. The
first, Francisco de San Joseph, was born in Jaca, Aragon, and shortly
after professing (June 12, 1632) he went to the Philippines. He was
soon sent to the Visayans, where he held several important posts. He
suffered greatly from the Moro raids for he was compelled more than
once to hide in the mountains from that fierce folk. He was elected
provincial in 1653 and during his term was a vigilant worker. At the
completion of his term he was sent to the village of Cuyo as associate
to the prior. His death occurred in the island of Rombl&oacute;n, where
he was mortally wounded by the Moros, while endeavoring to repel an
attack in the fort built by the famous Padre Capitan. He published an
explanation of the catechism in 1654 in Manila, and left numerous
manuscript works in both Spanish and Visayan. The father reader, Fray
Francisco de San Juan Bautista, was born in Alagon <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>of rich and noble
parentage. He professed in the Zaragoza convent, October 8, 1614, and
went to the Philippines in 1619. He read philosophy and theology in
Manila, and after the completion of a course in the arts was appointed
secretary to Fray Onofre de la Madre de Dios. He served as prior of the
villages of Marivelez, Cuyo, Bolinao, Calamianes, and Tandag, during
his mission work there learning three languages thoroughly. He was
essentially a worker and did not care to remain in either Manila or
Cavite, but desired the mission fields where danger was thickest. He
did not seek office, and it is related of him that he once delayed his
return to the chapter meeting because he heard that there was talk of
electing him provincial. Though he was twice definitor, he still sought
the hardest work, laboring among both infidels and Christians. The
Moros were especially vindictive to him and gave him many chances to
acquire merit. Finally he fell sick on the desolate island of Paragua,
and after reaching Manila through the efforts of some natives who
braved the risks of the Moros, he died in that city. Another active
worker was Fray Domingo de San Nicol&aacute;s, who was born at
Alcal&aacute; de Henares. The place of his profession is unknown, but
he is first met in the Philippines. He labored in the provinces of
Calamianes and Visayas, performing marvels until his feet having
swollen on account of the damp, he was ordered to retire to Ceb&uacute;
convent. There, however, instead of resting he engaged in the work of
the missions, for the laborers were few. He worked in many villages,
and finally met his death in consequence of exposure from a shipwreck
on the coast of Bohol, whither he had accompanied <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123">123</a>]</span>a vessel hastily
fitted out to secure information concerning a recent raid by the
Malanao Moros in Cagayan village. Although some of the other occupants
of the boat were drowned, the friar with others was saved by the
natives of Bohol, and sent back to Ceb&uacute;, where he died in a few
days. Fray Bernardino de la Concepcion (whose family name was
Dur&aacute;n) was born in Madrid, and took the habit in the same city,
December 8, 1636. He went to the Philippines in 1651 with Fray Jacinto
de San Fulgencio. His mission field was principally in the south, and
he served in the villages of Bislig, Cagayan, and Caraga. His work and
the necessity of opposing the Moro Mahometans so wore upon him that he
became unwell, but still he persevered in his labors for lost souls.
The treacherous Mindanaos won over his servant one day in Caraga, and
poison was administered through the agency of the latter, who also
apostatized. The attempt failed, however, but Fray Bernardino was sent
to the province of Zambales for a season. There he was of great use in
aiding to quell the insurrection. The quiet that ensued after their
pacification not proving to the liking of this intrepid warrior of the
faith he begged and obtained leave to go again to the province of
Caraga. Resuming his former vigils and labors there, he again fell sick
and this time died, being at the time prior of Cagayan. He could speak
the Visayan, Tag&aacute;log, and Zambal languages. Fray Carlos de
Jesus, son of Nicol&aacute;s L&eacute;conte, was born of Flemish
parents. After various fortunes he went to Madrid, and although a
brilliant life was offered him, for he was a scholar and fine
mathematician, he took the Recollect habit in the convent of that city,
January <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href=
"#pb124">124</a>]</span>2, 1648, being already at middle age. He also
accompanied Fray Jacinto de San Fulgencio to the Philippines in 1651.
He worked in Calamianes and Caraga, where his military genius as well
as his missionary traits shone out. He recalls the famous Padre Capitan
by his exploits, for he drilled and led the Indians as well as looked
after their souls, and his name became a terror to the Moros. In the
village of Busuagan, however, his native followers fled when attacked
by the Moros, and Fray Carlos was forced also to take refuge in a swamp
filled with brambles and thorns. For five days (the length of time that
the victorious Moros stayed in Busuagan) he remained in the swamp up to
his middle in water, and wounded by thorns and molested by swarms of
mosquitoes. Having retired to Manila because of illness brought on by
such events, his recovery found him anxious to return to his mission
field. The prudence, however, of the superiors, dictated his remaining
in Manila as prior of the convent of that city which was then vacant.
With his old-time ardor he threw himself into the work there, but the
effort was too great for one in his weakened state and another illness
seizing him he passed away. The lay-brother, Fray Francisco de San
Fulgencio, the son of Diego de Covarrubias, was born at Simancas. He
adopted the life of a soldier, and after serving in Spain went to Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a in the same capacity. Thence he went to Manila as
alf&eacute;rez of one of the companies raised for the islands. A
religious life appealing to him he adopted the Recollect habit
(December 17, 1620), and shortly after his arrival in Manila, he was
sent to Caraga to aid the fathers who were laboring in the missions
there. At the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href=
"#pb125">125</a>]</span>time of the insurrection, he was captured in
the village of Bacoag, but after four months of almost unendurable
captivity, was ransomed. After this he remained several years in
Caraga, but was finally recalled to Manila. His life was most active,
for he made five trips to Caraga, and three to Calamianes, with
despatches or to accompany the fathers going to those posts, and often
meeting with Moros on the way, was in continual danger. He was twice
wounded and twice shipwrecked. His death occurred in the convent of
Bagungbag&agrave;n.]</p>

<h4 class="normal">Chapter X</h4>

<p><i>Our religious propagate the Catholic faith in Zamb&agrave;les, a
province of Philipinas. Two religious die in Espa&ntilde;a, with great
marks of holiness.</i></p>

<p><i>The year 1670</i></p>

<div class="div4">
<h5 class="normal">&sect; I</h5>

<p><i>Information is given of the preaching of Ours in Zamb&agrave;les;
and that many Indians came newly to the Church.</i></p>

<p>396. ...Some people here in Espa&ntilde;a imagine that the first
illustrious champions of our reformed order who went to those countries
[<i>i.e.</i>, the Philippines], reared and finished the sightly
structure of that Church, and that the missionaries, their successors,
have been and are quite comfortable, and have no other occupation than
to maintain what the first ones built. It is a fact that, according to
the philosophic axiom that the conservation is equivalent to a second
production, that would not be doing little even did they do no more.
But as a matter of truth it must be said that if so holy a province
rests <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href=
"#pb126">126</a>]</span>in the conservation of the conquests acquired,
it also labors without end in the building and planting of other new
conquests. To this point the history has shown many of them,<a class= 
"noteref" id="xd0e1065src" href="#xd0e1065">18</a> and I shall narrate
others below. But this year we have the profitable and difficult
expedition which our ever tireless and laborious province made into the
Zamb&agrave;les Mountains, for the sake of obtaining not little growth
for the Christian faith.</p>

<p>397. The mountains called Zamb&agrave;les extend a distance of fifty
leguas from Mount Bat&agrave;n to the plains of Pangasin&agrave;n in
the island of Luz&ograve;n. They are peopled by an innumerable race,
who defend themselves from the Spanish arms almost within sight of
Manila, because of the roughness of the ground, and maintain along with
their heathenism, their barbarous customs. Who these people are can be
seen in volume i, to which we refer the reader,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1076src" href="#xd0e1076">19</a> We only warn him that the Indians
of whom that volume talks, inasmuch as they live in the beaches and
plains extending from Mariv&egrave;lez to Bolin&agrave;o, and being,
consequently, needed in the trade with Spaniards and civilized Indians,
are not so ferocious as those who without these mitigating
circumstances, inhabit the rough mountains of which we speak. Not a few
natives of several nations are found in that place. Some of them are
born in the dense thickets and are reared in the most barbaric
infidelity. Others are called Zimarr&ograve;nes, and have apostatized
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127">127</a>]</span>from
the Catholic faith, after having fled from the nearby Christian
villages. There is also an incredible number of blacks who, without
God, without king, without law, without civilization, without
settlement, live as though they had no rational soul. All of those
Indians, notwithstanding that they wage most bloody wars among
themselves, generally unite to oppose the Spanish arms, when the
Spaniards have attempted their conquest, and stake their greatest
reputation in shedding human blood.</p>

<p>398. The evangelical ministers have always fought with the sword of
the divine word against that wild forest of men almost unreasoning, and
with all the means dictated by charitable prudence, in order to convert
it into a pleasant garden by means of the Catholic faith. The Dominican
fathers stationed in the district of Pangasin&agrave;n, and in the
villages called El Partido, which are located on the opposite side of
Manila Bay, have always cast their net, and obtained not few hauls of
good fish. The Observantine Augustinian fathers have also done the same
from their missions in Pampanga, which border the above-mentioned
mountains. The fathers of the Society have done the same from the
village of San Math&egrave;o, which is situated almost on the brow of
the said mountains on the Manila side. And our discalced Recollects,
equally with those who have done most, have labored in this undertaking
at all times, without despising occasions. They have great opportunity
for doing that, for, as a general thing, ten or twelve laborers live in
the fifteen reduced villages of the Zambals, who occupy all the coast
for a distance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href=
"#pb128">128</a>]</span>of forty leguas from Bolin&agrave;o to
Mariv&egrave;lez, and surround all the above-mentioned mountains by the
sea side.</p>

<p>399. Thence, then, did the illustrious champions of our holy
reformed order generally issue in order to overrun the rough territory
of the mountains so that they might seize multiple spoils from the
enemy of souls, and direct them to eternal life. As those people are
very ferocious and difficult to convert, it was necessary to use gentle
methods there, making use of caresses rather than of noise and din.
Notwithstanding, on several occasions very many conversions of Indians,
Zimarr&ograve;nes and heathen, who were reduced to villages formed by
the indefatigable solicitation of our religious, were obtained. Then,
as appears from four letters of the definitory of that holy province,
which were written to our respective fathers vicars-general&mdash;the
first, June 20, 1646; the second, July 2, 1655; the third, June 14,
1658; and the fourth, July 4, 1668&mdash;more than one thousand five
hundred souls (at the date of the last letter) had been drawn from the
mountains, freed from the darkness of the heathen, and illumined with
the splendors of the Catholic faith. And it has been impossible to
discover who were the illustrious laborers who obtained so wonderful
trophies, in order to enrich history with their names.</p>

<p>400. But the most abundant season of those fruits was seen to be
during the triennium of April 21, 1668, to 1671. Our father, Fray
Christoval de Santa Monica, governed the province during those three
years. He having heightened and ennobled the missions of
Zamb&agrave;les, when other superior employments gave him the
opportunity, had placed there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129"
href="#pb129">129</a>]</span>the whole of his affections. On that
account, in addition to the great zeal that he had for the salvation of
souls, from the very chapter, he made up his mind that during the term
of his government, the utmost effort should be made to unfurl the
standard of the faith in the Zamb&agrave;les Mountains, and to have
salvation carried to its inhabitants on the wings of charity. For that
purpose he managed to have father Fray Joseph de la Trinidad, a native
of Zaragoza, a religious born, one would say, for the missions, elected
prior of Bolin&agrave;o. Later he appointed him vicar-provincial of the
jurisdiction of Zamb&agrave;les. That man, then, together with fathers
Fray Martin de San Pablo, prior of Masinloc, Fray Agustin de San
Nicol&agrave;s, prior of Mariv&egrave;lez, and six other religious, who
were appointed as helpers, fought against idolatry so tenaciously, that
our holy faith was incredibly advanced.</p>

<p>401. He arranged the attack upon that proud Jericho (more
impregnable because of the obstinacy of its inhabitants, than by the
wall of its inaccessible mountains) by ordering that it be assaulted at
the same time by several parts by different soldiers of so holy a
militia with the bugles of the divine word. One began the conquest by
the side of Bolin&agrave;o, another at Masinloc, two by Playahonda, and
two others by S&ugrave;big and Bag&agrave;c. The father
vicar-provincial went to all parts in order to direct actions, and to
fight in person with his accustomed success. The father provincial
also, with his secretary, then father Fray Diego de la Madre de Dios,
made it a point of honor to take part in so dangerous a field, whenever
the tasks of his office permitted, and they both fought as valiant
soldiers. For <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=
"#pb130">130</a>]</span>the expenses which were heavy for the
maintenance of many missions and for the other things which accompany
like expeditions, the province acted as proxy, for they did not wish to
have recourse to the royal treasury which generally supports such
undertakings. And to the labors which are indispensable in wars of that
quality, and which were excessive there, those illustrious warriors set
their shoulders, well armed with endurance, for they had already been
exercised in other conquests and had always been victorious.</p>

<p>402. Thus did they work constantly until the end of the year 1670,
and with so good result, that they converted that bitter sea of
idolatries and superstitions in great part into a leafy land of
virtues. On account of the insurrections which so great acts of
wickedness caused in Pangasin&agrave;n, Zamb&agrave;les, and
Pamp&agrave;nga, as I have already written in chapter i of this decade,
many whole families had fled from the Christian villages to the
mountains, together with a very great number of Indians, who having
abandoned the faith and subjection, lived there as the declared enemies
of God and of the king. Of those it appears that more than two thousand
souls were reduced, and another great number, which is not specified by
the relations, of other people of several nations, who had either been
born in heathendom, or had formerly deserted the Catholic camp. The
evangelical workers were greatly elated with that fruit and rewarded
for their unspeakable labors, and were encouraged beyond all manner to
follow up such conquests and even to undertake other new ones. For, it
is a fact that when the fruit of one&rsquo;s preaching can be seen, it
causes such joy in the missionaries, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb131" href="#pb131">131</a>]</span>gives them so great courage for
other undertakings that that alone can serve as a worthy reward in this
life and infuses valor for other more difficult enterprises.</p>

<p>403. Those zealous laborers formed anew from the people whom they
allured from the mountains, the villages of Iba, or as they are also
called, Paynav&egrave;n, Cavanga&agrave;n, S&ugrave;big, and
M&ograve;rong. In addition to this the ancient villages increased in
population. Until the present time, there was not along all that coast,
that belonged to our administration, more than three convents or
ministries&mdash;one even in Bolin&agrave;o, another in
Mas&igrave;nloc, and the third in Mariv&egrave;lez&mdash;with the
exception of that of Cigay&agrave;n, which was destroyed. But now two
new convents were established, which were necessary for the greater
convenience of the spiritual administration&mdash;one in
Paynav&egrave;n, under the title of Nuestro Padre San Agustin, to which
were assigned three annexes or visitas; a second in Bag&agrave;c with
the advocacy of Our Lady of the Pillar of Zaragoza (which was moved to
M&ograve;rong some years later under the same title), and to it were
assigned three other villages as visitas. All the above was completely
accomplished in the year 1670, with which this history is concerned.
That year can be marked by a white stone by that holy province and
indeed by our whole Recollect congregation, because of the so great
progress that was obtained in the propagation of the faith, the only
aim to which their desires were expended. Next to God, successes so
happy are due to the tenacity with which these zealous missionaries
worked, for they trampled all dangers under foot, and to the good
arrangements and holy wisdom of the father provincial, Fray <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132">132</a>]</span>Christoval
de Santa Monica, as well as to the zeal, courage, and care of his
vicar, father Fray Joseph de la Trinidad.</p>

<p>404. In order to conclude this matter we must add that the same
activity proceeded in the immediate years with equal fruit. For, as in
the chapter of 1671, father Fray Joseph de la Trinidad was elected
definitor, he besought the father provincial, Fray Juan de San Phelipe,
very urgently, to allow him to make a mission to the Zamb&agrave;les
Mountains. Permission having been obtained, he went to the convent of
Paynav&egrave;n and gave a new beginning to the conquest on the side
toward Bab&agrave;yan with results so favorable that he tamed the wild
and inhuman hearts of many Zimarr&ograve;nes and heathens. Hence,
during the three years of his definitorship the recently-created
villages were greatly increased by a considerable number of souls who
were allured from the mountains and brought into the Church. As payment
for this service, and in consideration of his many merits, he was
elected provincial in the chapter celebrated in the year 1674. The
first care of his successful government was to see that those missions
should be kept up. He sent two of the best religious to continue that
undertaking and finished the leveling of so impenetrable and rough
thickets.</p>

<p>405. Those laborers (whose names will be written in the book of
life, since, due to the omissions of the relations, they are lacking in
the book of history) penetrated into the mountains of Zamb&agrave;les
in such manner, that they arrived within a short time at the contrary
part of them toward Manila Bay. By so doing their approach to the
villages of the district of Bat&agrave;n, the administration of which,
as we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href=
"#pb133">133</a>]</span>have already stated, belongs to the Dominican
fathers, was indispensable. The latter, reasonably, as they thought,
took what had been done ill, saying that Ours were sowing the seed in a
field whose territory did not belong to them; for, in these bodies of
militia, more than in any other, it is easily perceived that triumphs
are taken from the hands of the one to advance others in their
obligations. Their father provincial, Fray Phelipe Pardo (later
archbishop of Manila), assumed charge of that litigation, alleging
before the royal Audiencia, that the conquest of that part of the
mountains belonged to his province, as it was contiguous to their
ministries. He petitioned that our discalced religious be ordered to
retire. But our father, Fray Joseph de la Trinidad, opposed that demand
so energetically that justice was compelled to decide that if the
extension of the Catholic flock followed, it mattered very little which
instruments were used, whether these or those ministers.</p>

<p>406. Divine Providence usually permits such rivalry, certainly holy
in itself in the holy squadrons that serve the God of armies for the
spiritual conquest of the world. Whenever judicial authority has
determined in this way, experience has demonstrated that great progress
follows in favor of the Catholic faith. For each side with the
incentive of the other, dares to undertake greater enterprises, and
repeated triumphs are obtained. So was it now; for seeing the door
locked to their demand in the above-said court, the father provincial,
Fray Phelipe Pardo, resolved to assign two religious of his order, so
that they might, with the zeal that he infuses in all of his holy
institute, make a mission thither by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb134" href="#pb134">134</a>]</span>way of Mount Bat&agrave;n. They
began that mission in the month of October, 1675, as is affirmed in his
history of Philipinas by father Fray Balthassar de Santa Cruz, although
he says nothing as to the reason for the expedition.<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e1113src" href="#xd0e1113">20</a> Accordingly Ours went to
another part, thus leaving a sufficient field for the Dominican
fathers, for truly, there is room enough for all. This strife being the
origin of the obstinate work of the missionaries of both families, who
labored with all their might, they reduced many Zambals to the bosom of
our holy faith, and filled their respective villages with new converts.
Had so laudable a rivalry continued, excellently founded hopes that so
glorious a conquest would be ended would have been conceived. But it
was God&rsquo;s will to have all the territory of Zamb&agrave;les
shortly after left for several years in charge of the fathers of St.
Dominic, while our laborers went to the territory of Mind&ograve;ro, as
we shall relate in chapter ix of the following decade. Thereupon the
strife entirely ceased, and even the fruit, so far as our reformed
order is concerned.</p>

<p>407. Father Fray Joseph de la Trinidad finished his provincialate in
April, 1677, and then immediately went in person to continue the
expedition that cost him so great anxiety. He penetrated the mountains
on foot in various places in order to seek sheep there whom he might
convey into the flock of Christ. Exposing himself to the will of their
barbaric natures, without any fear of the perils or caring for the
dangers to himself, he persevered there until he had to retire two
years later for the reasons given <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135"
href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>above. As we do not possess the necessary
manuscripts, we cannot state the number of souls that were drawn down
from the mountains from the year 1671 to that of 1679. The relations
which we follow only assure us that as it was not considered advisable
at that time to form settlements in the wildnesses of the mountains
many reduced families were withdrawn thence, in order to live in the
coast villages. Those villages have been augmented in tributes and
inhabitants, to such a degree that those ministries were constituted
with a great abundance of people and were the most flourishing of the
province, as they were so thickly populated by souls who embraced the
Catholic faith with fervor. In due time (decade 13, in the year 1741)
this history will show forth another most fruitful expedition, which
was made into the same mountains by our Recollect family, founding
there villages and convents in order to attend to whatever pertained to
them in the conversion of those Indians. Now we shall end this relation
by giving due thanks to God, for He has in all times infused into our
brothers a spirit fervent in undertaking, and in proceeding in such
obligations.</p>

<p>[The first four sections of the first chapter which covers the year
1671 deal with the life of the father lector, Fray Migu&egrave;l de
Santo Thom&agrave;s. Nothing is known of his early life, not even his
birthplace or his family name, nor the date or convent of his
profession. By some he is called Migu&egrave;l de San Agustin. His life
in the Philippines was almost all spent <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb136" href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>in the province of Caraga. He
shunned publicity, although he did fill several priorates. He worked in
the villages of Bislig, T&agrave;ndag, Siarg&agrave;o, and
Butu&agrave;n where he accomplished much, and where he was greatly
beloved by the natives. He endeavored to induce industrious habits in
the natives, and reclaimed many of them from the apostasy into which
they had fallen, besides strengthening old Christians and converting
heathen. He was especially devoted to the Virgin, to St. Augustine, and
to St. Nicholas of Tolentino. He is said to have been the object of
several marvelous occurrences which can be traced to his devotion. To
him also was vouchsafed at times the gift of prophecy. He labored
fearlessly in the insurrection of Linao and surrounding districts,
braving death more than once in his endeavors to pacify the Indians.
The sexual sin which was offered him failed to move him as did all
other dangers. His death occurred in Butu&agrave;n and he was buried in
the church there. The remainder of this chapter does not concern
Philippine affairs. The first section of chapter ii contains a notice
of the eleventh general chapter of the order held in Calatayud convent
in 1672. Fathers Fray Alonso de la Concepcion and Fray Joseph de la
Circuncision were elected definitors for the Philippines; and fathers
Fray Manuel de San Agustin, and Fray Lucas de San Bernardo, discreets.

<p><i>The Catholic faith makes new progress in Philipinas through the
preaching of our religious. Death of some religious in Espa&ntilde;a of
great reputation.</i></p>

<div class="div4">
<h5 class="normal">&sect; I</h5>

<p><i>A great multitude of heathen Tagabal&ograve;yes who lived in the
mountains near the district of Bislig, is converted in the island of
Mindan&agrave;o by the preaching of our tireless laborers.</i></p>

<p>600. [The author draws a parallel between the capture of Jericho by
the Hebrews and the evangelization of the Philippines. When God
pleases, the walls of idolatry must fall.] This maxim has followed our
reformed order in the Philipinas, and has been proved many times. For
contending almost continuously with paganism fortified in the mountains
contiguous to the districts reduced to their administration, although
they were disappointed by not few fatigues, without being able to sing
victory, they were at last crowned with triumphs when it appeared
fitting to divine Providence. We have seen and shall see several
activities that prove this truth. At the present we are offered the
feats performed in the mountains of Bisl&igrave;g.</p>

<p>601. The district of Bisl&igrave;g, which is the last and most
distant from Manila among those possessed there by our reformed order,
is located in Carh&agrave;ga, in the island of Mindan&agrave;o and
consists of five villages. These are Bisl&igrave;g, which is the chief
one, Hinat&ograve;an, Cat&egrave;l, Bag&agrave;ngan, and
Carh&agrave;ga. At its beginning the province was named from the last
one, as it was then the settlement of the greatest population. Two
religious only are generally designated <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb138" href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>for the spiritual administration
of this district, and they have too much work in the exercise of it.
For the villages are located at great distances from one another, the
people are especially warlike, they are contiguous to the Moros, those
irreconcilable enemies, while the sea of those districts on which they
have to travel from one village to another, is extremely boisterous,
rough, and at times impassable, and on its reef in the dangers already
mentioned, several religious have lost their lives, as will be patent
further on in this history. But, notwithstanding that the two religious
assigned to those villages can scarcely attend fully to the direction
of the Christian Indians, and although because of the dearth of
religious from which our reformed order almost always suffers in those
islands, but rarely could more subjects be employed there, those few
following the maxim practiced there of one doing the work of many, they
did not cease to solicit ever the conversion of the surrounding
heathens, who are very numerous in those mountains.</p>

<p>602. There is especially so great a number of heathen Indians and
barbarous nations in certain mountains that extend along the coast,
from opposite Carh&agrave;ga near Bisl&igrave;g (a distance of about
twenty-five leguas, while it is not known how far they extend inland),
that even the Christian Indians do not know them all. The nearest
nation to our villages is that of the Tagabal&ograve;yes, who are so
named from certain mountains which they call Balo&ograve;y. They live
amid their briers without submission to the Catholic faith or to the
monarchy of Espa&ntilde;a. Those Indians are domestic, peaceable,
tractable, and always allied with the Christians, whom they <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139">139</a>]</span>imitate in
being irreconcilable enemies of the Moros. They are a very corpulent
race, well built, of great courage and strength, and they are at the
same time of good understanding, and more than half way industrious.
That nation is faithful in its treaties, and constant in its promises,
as they are descendants, so they pride themselves, of the Japanese,
whom they resemble in complexion, countenance, and manners. Their life
is quite civilized, and they show no aversion to human society. All
those of the same kin, however extensive, generally live in one house,
the quarters being separated according to the families. Those houses
are built very high, so that there are generally two pike lengths from
the ground to the first floor. The whole household make use of only one
stairway, which is constructed so cunningly, that when all are inside
they remove it from above, and thus they are safe from their enemies.
Many of those Tagabal&ograve;yes live near the Christians, and those
peoples have mutual intercourse, and visit and aid one another. They do
not run away from our religious, but on the contrary like to
communicate with them, and show them the greatest love and respect.
Hence any ministers can live among them as safely as in a Christian
village.</p>

<p>603. It is now seen how suitable are all these districts to induce
so docile a nation to receive our holy faith. But for all that, very
little progress was made in their reduction until the year 1671, and
then it was that the care and the continual preaching of Ours obtained
it. Besides the will of God, whose resolutions are unsearchable, there
were several motives of a natural order, which made the attempts of the
evangelical ministers fruitless. The first was <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140">140</a>]</span>the continual wars with the
Moros. That fact scarcely permitted the Christians and even the <span
class="corr" id="xd0e1161" title="Source: Tagabol&ograve;yes">
Tagabal&ograve;yes</span> to let their weapons out of their hands. With
the din of arms the Catholic religion, always inclined to quiet and
peace, can generally make but little progress. The second consisted in
the little or no aid rendered in this attempt by the alcalde-mayor, the
military leaders of Cat&egrave;l, and even some chiefs of the subject
villages. All of the above were assured of greater profits in their
trade and commerce, if those Indians were heathens than if they were
Christians; and it is very old in human malice that the <span class= 
"corr" id="xd0e1164" title="Source: fisrt">first</span> objects of
anxiety are the pernicious ideas of greed, and the progress of the
faith is disregarded if it opposes their cupidity.</p>

<p>604. But the strongest reason for the failure of the desired fruit
was the third. This reason is reduced, as we have already mentioned, to
the fact that there were but two religious generally in the said
district, and of those no one could be in residence at the villages of
Cat&egrave;l or Carh&agrave;ga, the nearest ones to the said mountains,
and they only went thither two or three times per year. Consequently,
although they wished never so strongly to labor in the conversion of
the heathen Indians, they could not obtain the fruit up to the measures
of their desires. It happened almost always that the minister was
detained a fortnight at most, in the said villages, the greater part of
which was necessarily spent in instructing the Christians. And
although, by stealing some hours from sleep, the minister employed some
of them in catechizing the heathens, since his stay was so short, he
could not give the work the due perfection, and left it in its
beginning, as he had to go to the other <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb141" href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>villages. He charged some
Christians to continue in preparing and cultivating those souls so that
they might be ready on his return to receive baptism. But human
weakness, united to the sloth, which almost as if native to him,
accompanies the Indian, was the reason that when the religious returned
after an interval of four or six months, instead of finding the work
advanced, he found that which he himself had done in it lost. And
idolatry always triumphed, notwithstanding that he did not cease to
make vigorous war upon it.</p>

<p>605. Thus time rolled on, and the Church obtained very little
increase in those mountains, for the three above-mentioned reasons. The
order could not conquer the two first, and there was less possibility
for the third. For however much the order desired to apply on its part
the only means whereby the desired fruit could be obtained, namely, the
assignment of a religious to reside in the said places, who should look
after the reduction of the Tagabal&ograve;yes, without attending to any
other thing, it was continually unable to effect that, for in
Philipinas the harvest is very great and the laborers few. I have
detained myself in the consideration of these obstacles, which threaten
the total devastation of the heathendom of Philipinas, and are
transcendental to all the holy orders, who are striving to spread the
faith in the said islands. For some believe (and more than two have
expressed as much to me here in Espa&ntilde;a in familiar conversation)
that the reason why the heathenism of those countries has not been
ended, is because the missionaries do not work with the same spirit as
they did at the beginning. But they are surely deceived, for in
addition to the many <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href=
"#pb142">142</a>]</span>other reasons that may be assigned, the three
above-mentioned suffice to render the most laborious efforts vain. The
same tenacity, zeal, and courage of the first laborers accompanies
those who have succeeded them. Let the obstacles be removed, and one
will see that (as has been experienced many times) Belial having been
destroyed and cut into pieces, although many render him adoration, the
Catholic faith triumphs in the ark of the testament. This happened at
the time of which we treat in the mountains of Bisl&igrave;g.</p>

<p>606. The year, then, of 1671 came, in which that holy province held
their chapter and father Fray Juan de San Phelipe, a native of Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, who had taken our holy habit in the convent of Manila,
was elected provincial. That religious had lived for some years in
Bisl&igrave;g, and had known by experience how necessary it was for a
missionary to live in residence near the mountains, where so great
infidelity was fortified, in order to establish there the
health-bringing dogmas of our Catholic religion. Scarcely was he
elected superior prelate, since he had a sufficient number of subjects
in order to attend to all parts, when he resolved to place one of them
in residence at Cat&egrave;l, and to order such an one solemnly that he
should from there procure the reduction of those heathens by all means
without engaging in other cares, however useful they seemed to him. He
also gave very rigorous orders to the father prior of Bisl&igrave;g to
the effect that whenever they could without any omission in the
spiritual administration of the other villages, he or his associates
should go to reside in the village of Carh&agrave;ga, and be there in
residence as much as possible, all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143"
href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>three religious concurring in that great
work and aiding one another mutually for the attainment of so well
conceived desires. Finally he arranged matters with so much acumen that
if the lack of religious had not rendered it impossible after such
ideas had been put into practice, it is probable that they would have
subdued all the heathens of those mountains.</p>

<p>607. In August 1671 that project was begun to be put into operation;
and although we have not yet been able to get detailed information of
the laborers, who were employed in it, on account of which we cannot
place their names in this history, we shall have the consolation of
knowing that they will not be omitted from the book of life. It is
certain that all three religious conspired together in bringing to the
delicious net of the Church those misguided souls, and they shirked no
toil that might help in their object. They made raid after raid into
those mountains; one from Cat&egrave;l, one from Carh&agrave;ga, and
one from Bisl&igrave;g, penetrating to their highest peaks, and their
deepest valleys in all their extent from the promontory of
Calat&agrave;n nearly to the cape called San Agustin. All three of them
at the same time were careful to assist the Christians in the spiritual
administration. They preached, catechized, attracted the people by
argument, by art, by prudence. And as some truce occurred in the war
with the Moros at that time, and as they obtained at the same time a
very Christian alcalde-mayor who aided them and caused all his
subordinates to aid them in so holy zeal, so much fruit was obtained
that when the father provincial went on his visit in February 1673, he
found that they had already baptized more than <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>three hundred adults
without reckoning those who had been purified in the waters of grace in
sickness and had immediately died. The latter were as many as one
hundred counting great and small.</p>

<p>608. Thus did the above-mentioned father provincial, Fray Juan de
San Phelipe, write to our father vicar-general under date of July 5, of
the same year. And after, on June 26, 1674, he adds that, according to
the relations sent to the chapter by the father prior of Bisl&igrave;g,
that district had increased by two hundred tributes. This, according to
the reckoning in vogue there, means eight hundred souls. They had all
been allured from the mountains and from the horrors of their paganism
to become inhabitants of the villages already formed, and to live in
civilized intercourse among the pleasant lights of the Christian name.
This well premeditated idea has since then been followed as has been
possible by the successors of our father, Fray Juan de San Phelipe,
whenever the small number of religious has not rendered it impossible.
For in some chapters of that holy province, repeated determinations are
seen to place a minister in residence at Cat&egrave;l, so that he may
exercise the means conducive to that end. Hence it is that father Fray
Juan Francisco de San Antonio has inserted the following narrative in
his seraphic chronicle. He says: &ldquo;Some of the Tagabal&ograve;yes
are living now in old villages who have become Christians, and others
are being reduced by the zeal and cultivation of the discalced
Augustinian fathers, who hold them as inhabitants of
Bisl&igrave;g.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1185src" href=
"#xd0e1185">21</a> And it is confirmed that although the <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>district of
Bisl&igrave;g was formerly one of the smallest in the number of its
parishioners, it is now one of the largest in Mindan&agrave;o, and
there is no other reason for its increase.</p>

<p>[The two following sections of this chapter detail several
miraculous happenings that aided not a little in the conversion of the
region inhabited by the Tagabal&ograve;yes. In 1662 when the Spaniards
abandoned the island of Ternate, because of the Chinese pirate Kuesing,
one of the religious images taken away with them was of the Virgin.
That image was given by the governor of Ternate to the alcalde-mayor of
Caraga, who in turn gave it to the garrison of Cat&egrave;l. From its
position there it was known as &ldquo;La Virgen de la Costa&rdquo; or,
the Virgin of the hill, &ldquo;for <i lang="es">costa</i> in the
language of the country, is the same as <i lang="es">castillo</i>
[<i>i.e.</i>, redoubt].&rdquo; The influence of this image was far
reaching and it distributed many blessings and favors to its devotees
in times of drought, in plagues of locusts, and during epidemics, and
performed other miracles that gave it lasting fame. Another image of
the Christ crucified was revered in a village near Bisl&igrave;g, and
was later given a place in the Recollect church at Manila. It was a
small ordinary image such as was used on the altar during mass. As it
was very ugly and misshapen the priest determined to bury it, ordering
some of the natives to perform that task. But when the hole was dug,
and they went to get the image, in its place they found the most
beautiful and symmetrical image that they had ever seen, and nailed to
the same cross. The transformation was announced to be of divine
origin, and this image was accordingly revered as miraculous; and it
proved itself to be so in the future. On <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

occurred in the Caraga district the people became more devout
Christians and many abandoned their ancient practices. The remainder of

<p><i>The evangelical trumpet resounds in various territories of

of Cagay&agrave;n, in the island of Mindan&agrave;o, by the means of
our missionaries; and many heathens are converted to the Christian
religion.</i></p>

<p>714. It has ever been a very common complaint among historians of
the order, and all make it, of time the destroyer of all things and of
the neglect in leaving advisory news thereof. There is no doubt that
for these two reasons the memory of many valiant deeds of excellent
religious, who have filled our discalced Recollect order with honors in
the Philipinas Islands, who have extended the Catholic faith untiringly
at the cost of unspeakable hardships, and destroyed the abominable
altars of heathen blindness, have been lost. But never more than at
present does that complaint appear justifiable, when we begin to treat
of the progress of Christianity in the districts <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>of Lin&agrave;o and
Cagay&agrave;n, villages of the island of Mindan&agrave;o, one of the
Philipinas. There was the evangelical trumpet heard by dint of members
of our reformed order, with memorable fruit.... Let us pass then to
mention what we have been able to bring to light from the confused
memories which time excused.</p>

<p>715. In the year 1674, father Fray Joseph de la Trinidad, a native
of Zaragoza, was elected provincial in Philipinas. That apostolic
laborer had always had great zeal for the conversion of souls. Agitated
by that sacred fire that burned without consuming his heart which fed
it, he worked in his own person, as much as he who did most, so that
all the heathens of that distant archipelago should embrace, believe,
and reverence the faith of the true God, in whose name only is found
salvation. For that purpose he went not only once into the highest
peaks of Zamb&agrave;les, in order to illumine their darkness with the
Catholic light or to lose his life in so heroic an act of charity. He
desired with unspeakable anxiety to be given the opportunity to make a
sacrifice of his blood by shedding it in so good warfare, in
confirmation of the truth which he was preaching. &ldquo;When shall I
have the desirable happiness,&rdquo; he exclaimed to his pious fellow
countryman, San Pedro Arbu&egrave;s, &ldquo;of being made a good martyr
from a bad priest by the merciful God?&rdquo; That desire we see
already had made him leave every fear; and consequently, without any
horror of death, notwithstanding that it represented itself to him as
to all, full of bitterness, he placed himself in excessive dangers, in
order that he might whiten with the water of baptism the souls of the
inhabitants of those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href=
"#pb148">148</a>]</span>ridges, so that in their darkened bodies they
might obtain the beauty of grace. Thus was his practice throughout his
life, not only in the above-mentioned district, but also in other
places of the many which are entrusted to us in those vast territories,
and if he did not effectively obtain the crown of martyrdom, yet the
merited reward will not be lacking to such prowess.</p>

<p>716. He did that when he was not the superior prelate, but
afterwards when he became provincial, he flew with his cares to
undertakings of almost infinite breadth. He beheld very near the great
empire of China, peopled by an incredible multitude of souls, almost
all of them seated in the shadows of death, and their acute intellects
ignorantly disturbed in the obscure darkness of their errors. The
mission so often craved by our reformed order to those countries, was
the first object of his zealous heart. He could not be satisfied with
trying to send others as evangelical laborers, but he tried with the
greatest seriousness to abandon the glory of the provincialate, in
order that he might be employed personally in an expedition so much to
divine service, and his inability to accomplish it cost him many a
bitter sob. He became a sea of tears, when he thought of the distant
kingdoms (also almost in sight) of Jap&ograve;n, Born&egrave;y,
Sum&agrave;tra, Tunqu&igrave;n, Cochinchina, Mog&ograve;l,
Tart&agrave;ria, and Persia; for most of those who have their wealth
and amenities live but as mortals basely deceived by their brutish
worships, in order to die eternally in the more grievous life. To some
of those places and especially to Jap&ograve;n, he had practical ideas
of sending missionaries, and even of going thither in person, and he
made the greatest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href=
"#pb149">149</a>]</span>efforts for that purpose. And although he did
not obtain the end of his desires, because of the obstructions which
the common enemy is wont to place to such works, such eagerness cannot
but be praised very highly; and consequently, they will have been
rewarded with great degrees of glory, because of what he was trying to
communicate to the souls of others.</p>

<p>717. Since, then, he could not accomplish so well conceived love
which extended itself to the salvation of the whole world, he set in
operation the maxims which his burning charity dictated to him in
regard to the extensive limits entrusted by the Lord of the vineyard of
the Philipinas for the cultivation of our holy discalced order, with a
so visible utility to the Church. In the first place he arranged with
admirable prudence that certain missionary religious should incessantly
travel through the villages of our administration, like swift angels or
like light clouds in order to preach the obligation of their character
to the Christian Indians. They were to advise them at the same time to
take the sacraments frequently, of the horror of idolatry, of the love
of the faith, of obedience to the Church, and to the appreciable
submission to the Catholic king from which so many blessings would
follow to them, and by which they would be delivered from innumerable
evils. For that purpose he assigned two religious of the Visayan
language, one of the Tag&aacute;log, and one of the Zambal&mdash;all of
the spirit that such an occupation demanded. He ordered each one of
them to make continual journeys through the large and small settlements
of the district of his language, preaching the mission with the same
formalities that they are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href= 
"#pb150">150</a>]</span>wont to observe in Europa. He also ordered the
father priors of the respective districts to give such fathers every
aid for that apostolic ministry, both temporal and spiritual, as such
was for the service of God and the greater purity of our Catholic
faith.</p>

<p>718. The profits and good effects that followed that undertaking
happily instituted, and reduced to fact with rare success, cannot be
easily explained. Oh would that the lack of religious almost
transcendental in all times in that province did not prevent the
prosecution and perpetuity of so holy a custom by which unspeakable
harvests of spiritual blessings were obtained, although some temporal
riches should be spent in it. It is true that the ministers of parish
priests of our said order who live continually in the villages, attend
to those duties without avoiding any toil. But since they always live
among their parishioners, and treat them so near at hand, and since
they exercise over them a certain kind of authority, greater than that
which the curas in Espa&ntilde;a possess, it will not be imprudent to
observe (considering human weakness, and the cowardice of the Indians),
that some will not go to confess to those said parish priests without
great fear, the common enemy infusing them with fears lest the parish
priests perhaps will punish them for the sins that they might confess.
Let us add to this that there are no other confessors on whom to rely,
especially in the districts which are at some distance from Manila.
Also it is almost impossible as our ministries are located, for the
Indians to go from one village to another for that purpose. For these
reasons, I myself have experienced, and I have heard it asserted by
many curates that too many sacrilegious confessions are made, for sins
are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href=
"#pb151">151</a>]</span>kept hidden out of shame, to the deplorable
ruin of souls. All the above impediments cease undeniably so far as the
missionaries are concerned. Hence one can infer the great fruit that
would be gathered in spiritual matters by means of the profitable idea
which was invented by our father Fray Joseph and put in practice in his
time with the utmost ardor.</p>

<p>719. Besides that, by causing his subjects to multiply, since not in
number, at least in their courage for work, the vigilant superior
ordered those who were in the ministries to perform with the utmost
effort what they had always done, namely, that they should not be
content with directing the souls of the faithful to heaven, but should
strive with might and main for the conversion of the heathen. And since
the fire of love as regards God, their provincial, and their neighbors,
burned with intensity in those gospel laborers, one can not imagine how
greatly the activity of that fire, strengthened with the breath of the
exhortation of so worthy a prelate, was increased and worked outside.
We can assert without any offense to anyone else what has already been
suggested in other parts of this history, namely, that our discalced
religious in the Philipinas Islands, outstripped all the other
religious in the so meritorious quality of suffering hardships.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e1246src" href="#xd0e1246">22</a> The villages
most distant from Manila, those that offer less convenience for human
life, those with the most ferocious people, and all surrounded by
Moros, by heathens, and by other barbarous Indians, in regard to whom
any confidence would be irrational, are the ones in our charge. And
adding to this that one minister <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152"
href="#pb152">152</a>]</span>generally has charge of many settlements,
which are at times located in distinct islands, one can easily see how
many fatigues, sweatings, and how much weariness will be caused by the
spiritual administration of those who are enlisted in the Catholic
religion. What will all that be then, if they have to attend also to
the reduction of so great a number of souls, who live lawless in
idolatry in sight of the law of grace! I repeat that our Recollects,
equal in their zeal to the other gospel laborers, exceed them there
without difficulty in the necessary opportunities for suffering.
Moreover, if our brothers have the advantage at all times in this
regard of other missionaries, those of the triennium of which we are
speaking, excelled themselves, for they labored more than ever in the
administration of the faithful and in the conversion of the
heathen.</p>

<p>720. But the greatest efforts that the venerable father provincial
put forth, and the places where the religious assigned for that work
labored with excessive fervor, were in the districts of Butu&agrave;n
and Cagay&agrave;n, which are located in the island of Mindan&agrave;o.
There was a heathen Indian called Dato Pistig Mat&agrave;nda, who had
been living for many years on the banks of the river Butu&agrave;n
between the villages of Lin&agrave;o and Hoth&igrave;bon. He was of
noble rank, a lord of vassals, and had great power and a not slight
understanding, although he was corrupted with an execrable multitude of
vices. He, instigated by the devil, had caused all the efforts of the
evangelical ministers to return fruitless for many years; for idolatry
maintained not only in the castle of his soul, but as well in all the
territory of his jurisdiction, the throne which it had usurped, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153">153</a>]</span>the
continual assaults which were made without cessation against that
obstinate heart by the members of our discalced order had no effect.
Several religious had endeavored to make him submit to the sweet yoke
of the evangelical law, and they availed themselves with holy zeal of
all the stratagems which, as incentives, generally attract the human
will to reason and open the door to grace in order that it may work
marvels. Especially did the holy father Fray Migu&egrave;l de Santo
Thom&agrave;s, make use of all the means that he considered fitting to
reduce the Indian chief to the true sheepfold as well as those who were
strayed from it in his following, during the whole time that he graced
that river by his presence. But experience proved that God reserved the
triumph solicited on so many occasions for the happy epoch of which we
are treating at present, for his own inscrutable reasons. At that time
then the divine vocation working powerfully and mildly, and availing
itself as instruments of our religious who resided in Butu&agrave;n and
in Lin&agrave;o, softened that erstwhile bronze heart and he not only
received baptism, but also tried by all means to have his vassals do
the same. Hence, leaving out of account a great number of children, the
adults who were re&euml;ngendered in the waters of salvation and became
sons of God and heirs of glory, exceeded three hundred.</p>

<p>721. At the same time another father, who had a residence in the
village of Lin&agrave;o, notably advanced our Christian religion in
places thitherto occupied by infidelity. The mountains of that
territory are inhabited by a nation of Indians, heathens for the
greater part called Man&ograve;bos<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1257src"
href="#xd0e1257">23</a>&mdash;a word signifying <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>in that language, as if we
should say here, &ldquo;robust and very numerous people.&rdquo; When
those Indians are not at war with the Spaniards, they are tractable,
docile, and quite reasonable. They have the very good peculiarities of
being separated not a little from the brutish life of the other
mountain people thereabout; for they have regular villages, where they
live in human sociability in a very well ordered civilization. Although
the above qualities, as has been seen, are very apropos for receiving
the faith, notwithstanding that fact, although some of them are always
reduced, they are very few when one considers the untiring solicitude
with which our missionaries unceasingly endeavor to procure it. The
reasons for so deplorable an effect are the same as we have mentioned
in regard to the conversion of the Tagabal&ograve;yes Indians. But
during the provincialate of our father Fray Joseph de la Trinidad,
either because those obstacles ceased, or because divine grace wished
to extend its triumphs, the results were wonderful. A very great number
of those Man&ograve;bos were admitted into the Church&mdash;how many is
not specified by the relations which we have been able to investigate,
but we only see that they were many; for it is asserted that while the
district of Butu&agrave;n, to which Lin&agrave;o belonged, consisted
before that time of about three thousand reduced souls, its
Christianity increased then by about one-third, the believers thus
being increased for God and the vassals for the king.</p>

<p>722. In the mountains of Cagay&agrave;n, shone also the light of
disillusionment, without proving hateful but very agreeable to rational
eyes, for it caught them well disposed. The zealous workers of our
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href=
"#pb155">155</a>]</span>Institute, shaken with the zeal of the
venerable father provincial, devoted themselves to felling that bramble
thicket which was filled with buckthorns of idolatry and even with
thorns hardened in the perfidious sect of Mahomet. Three religious, who
glorified that district, attended to so divine an occupation, stealing
for it from the rest of the moments that were left to them from the
spiritual administration which was the first object of their duty. They
extended their work toward the part of Tagal&ograve;an, and even
penetrated inland quite near the lake of Malan&agrave;o through all the
mountains of their jurisdiction. There like divine Orpheuses they
converted brutes into men by the harmonious cithara of the apostolic
preaching and those who were living, in the most brutish barbarity to
the Christian faith, which is so united to reason. Thus did they reduce
more than one hundred tributes to the villages of the Christians. That
was a total of five hundred souls who were all drawn from their
infidelity or apostasy. That triumph was so much more wonderful as at
that time the war of the Malan&agrave;o Moros against the presidio of
Cagay&agrave;n was more bloody, and it is verified by experience that
in all contests, the Catholic faith generally advances but little amid
the clash of arms. But their increases, which we have related (as
obtained in the triennium of the venerable father, Fray Joseph de la
Trinidad, which was concluded in April, 1677) appear from several
letters written in <span class="corr" id="xd0e1269" title="Source: 
Man&igrave;la">Manila</span> by the most excellent religious in June
and July of the above-mentioned year, and directed to our father the
vicar-general, Fray Francisco de San Joseph, which have been preserved
in the archives of Madrid. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href= 
"#pb156">156</a>]</span></p>

<p>[Section ii of this chapter relates a number of miraculous
occurrences in the villages of Butu&agrave;n, Lin&agrave;o, and
Cagay&agrave;n, and their districts&mdash;miracles which were greater
than the recovery of health on receiving baptism, at the reading of the
gospels, or after drinking the water left in the chalice after the
sacrament, all of which were very common and little regarded. Those
miracles had great weight in reducing those people to the Christian
faith. For instance the dato above mentioned, Putig (or Pistig)
Matanda, was converted after the successful exorcism of demons that had
troubled his village. It is related in this section that &ldquo;for
reasons that seemed fitting, the convent and church of <span class=
"corr" id="xd0e1275" title="Source: Butuan">Butu&agrave;n</span> were
moved to the beach from their previous location; but it was afterward
re&euml;stablished there, one legua from the sea upstream.&rdquo; One
of these years also the village of Cagay&agrave;n suffered greatly from
the scourge of smallpox which was formerly so common in the
Philippines. Section iii treats of Spanish affairs. Section iv deals
with the life of Fray Melchor de la Madre de Dios who died in the
Recollect convent of Talavera de la Reyna, Spain, May 30, 1677. He was
born in Nueva Segovia or Cagayan in Luz&oacute;n, his father being Juan
Rodrigues de Ladera. While still young his parents removed to Manila
where he studied until the age of twenty the subjects of grammar,
philosophy, and theology. Although he was apt, he found himself below
others not so clever as himself because the pleasures of the world
appealed to him too strongly. Consequently, he quit his studies in
disgust, and gave himself to trade, &ldquo;the occupation of which is
not considered disgraceful there to people of the highest rank.&rdquo;
But his evil <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href=
"#pb157">157</a>]</span>courses still prevailed and during his several
trips to Acapulco he succeeded only in wasting his money. Returning to
Manila after his final voyage, he gave up some of his worst vices, but
still kept a firm grip of the world. He must have taken up his
neglected studies again, but almost nothing is known of him until he
reached his thirty-third year. It is said by some that he became a
priest before joining the Recollect order, but there is a lack of
definite knowledge on that score. At any rate he did not abandon his
rather loose way of living. In the midst of his vices he had always
been greatly devoted to St. Augustine, and his conversion finally
occurred on the eve of that saint. Then a vision of the saint who
appeared to him caused his conversion and an enthusiasm that never left
him. He became a novitiate in the Recollect convent of Manila that same
year 1639 and professed in 1640. After preaching with great clearness
and force in Manila which had been the scene of his excesses, he was
sent as missionary to the Visayan Islands, where he worked faithfully
and well. But breaking down in health because of his strenuous life in
the snaring of souls, he was compelled to retire to the convent of
Ceb&uacute; and then to that of Manila. It being impossible for him to
accomplish much work longer in the Philippines because of his health,
he begged and received permission to go to Spain for the remainder of
his life. When he went is uncertain, but it was after 1656, for that
year he was in Siargao in the province of Caraga. After his arrival at
Madrid he was assigned to the convent of Talavera de la Reyna, where
his memory was revered after death for his good works.] <span class=

<h4 class="normal">Chapter IX</h4>

<p><i>Our province of Philipinas takes charge of the spiritual

are founded. Several religious venerated as saints, end their days in
Espa&ntilde;a.</i></p>

<p><i>The year 1679</i></p>

<div class="div4">
<h5 class="normal">&sect; I</h5>

<p><i>Description of the island of Mind&ograve;ro, and considerations
in regard to its spiritual conquest, which was partly obtained before
our discalced order assumed its administration.</i></p>

<p> ... 785. Mind&ograve;ro is located in the center of the islands
called Philipinas. It is surrounded by all those islands, and is
encircled by them in a close band as the parts of the human body do the
heart. It has a triangular shape whose three ends are three capes or
promontories, one of which is called Burrunc&agrave;n and looks to the
south, another looks to the north and is called Dum&agrave;li, while
the third which looks to the west is called Calav&igrave;te. In regard
to its extent, Mindoro comes to be the seventh in size among all the
islands of that great archipelago.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1303src"
href="#xd0e1303">24</a> It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href= 
"#pb159">159</a>]</span>is about one hundred leguas in circumference.
Its climate is very hot, although the continual rains somewhat temper
its unendurable heat. In its rains it exceeds all the other nearby
islands. However this relief bears the counterpoise of making the
island but little favorable to health, because of the bad consequences
of the heat accompanied by the humidity. But for all that it is a very
fertile land, although unequally so because of its rough mountain
ranges, and the thick forests. There are many trees of the yonote,<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e1313src" href="#xd0e1313">25</a> and of the
buri, from which sago is made, which is used for bread in some places.
There are also wax, honey, the fruits of the earth, flesh, abundance of
fish, and rice where the people do not neglect through laziness to
plant it. That island was formerly called Mainit, but the Spaniards
called it Mind&ograve;ro from a village called Min&ograve;lo which is
located between the port of Galeras and the bay of Il&ograve;g.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e1331src" href="#xd0e1331">26</a></p>

<p>786. Its inhabitants had sufficient courage to cause all their
neighbors to fear them. Especially at sea were they powerful and daring
as was lamented at different times by the islands of Pan&agrave;y,
Luz&ograve;n, and others, when they were attacked by the fleets of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href=
"#pb160">160</a>]</span>Mind&ograve;ro which they completely filled
with blood and fire. But at the same time they showed a very great
simplicity, which was carried to so great an extreme, as is mentioned
by father Fray Gasp&agrave;r de San Agustin, that when they saw the
Europeans with clothes and shoes&mdash;a thing unknown among
them&mdash;they imagined that that adornment was the product of nature
and not placed through ingenious modesty.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1341src" href="#xd0e1341">27</a> That simplicity produced in them
the effect of their not applying themselves to the cultivation of the
earth, but of contenting themselves with wild fruit and what they could
steal as pirates, or better said, robbers. The sequel of that so far as
their laziness is concerned, has lasted even to our own times; for as
says father Fray Juan Francisco de San Antonio, all who have discussed
the matter, agree that they are the laziest people and the most averse
to work of all the inhabitants in those islands, notwithstanding that
they are corpulent enough.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1347src" href= 
"#xd0e1347">28</a> However, my experience of the Philipinas obliges me
to say that so blamable a peculiarity is only too common to all of
them, almost without any distinction of more or less. Neither could
that courage of theirs save them from subjection to Espa&ntilde;a, and
if they earlier considered that subjection unfortunate in the extreme,
now they regard it with the light of the faith as their greatest
fortune.</p>

<p>787. A beginning in its conquest was made on the Mamb&ugrave;rao
side in the year 1570 by Captain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161"
href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>Juan de Salc&egrave;do.<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e1357src" href="#xd0e1357">29</a> That conquest was completed so
far as the seacoasts are concerned from the cape of Burrunc&agrave;n to
that of Calav&igrave;te at the beginning of the following year by the
adelantado, Migu&egrave;l Lopez de Legazpi. The balance of the island
has been subdued gradually by dint of the evangelical laborers with the
exception of the mountains which are located in its center. From that
time, then, the seacoast Indians of that island have been subject to
the mild yoke of the Spanish crown, and have given signs of extreme
loyalty. For, although the great Chinese pirate Lima&ograve;n attacked
the Philipinas in the year 1574, in order to seize them if possible,
there were some signs of insurrection in Mind&ograve;ro, which was put
down very quickly, even before one felt its effects which are generally
very painful in popular uprisings. That good fortune was due to the
moderation of the natives and to the temperance of Captain Gabriel de
Ribera, who knew how to sweeten with very pleasing acts of kindness the
bitter crust of justice. For that reason of the Indians being entirely
well inclined to the Spaniards, the encomiendas of that great island
were very desirable to the primitive conquistadors. In spiritual
matters the island belongs to the archbishopric of Manila. In regard to
civil matters, it is governed by a corregidor and captain of war, who
generally has residence in it and extends his jurisdiction to the
neighboring islands of Marind&ugrave;que and Lucb&agrave;n.</p>

<p>788. Let us now speak of its spiritual conquest, which is the
principal object of our consideration. In the year 1543 the Observant
religious, the sons <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href=
"#pb162">162</a>]</span>of the best beloved Benjamin, our common
father, San Agustin (to whom fell the first and greater part of the
possession for the conversion of the heathen, so far as that
archipelago is concerned) made the Philipinas Islands happy by their
presence by commencing to establish their apostolic preaching;<a class= 
"noteref" id="xd0e1367src" href="#xd0e1367">30</a> and later in the
year 1565, they settled in order to complete what they had begun. Like
stars rain-laden with the evangelical doctrine those most zealous
ministers fertilized their Philipinas inheritance with their voluntary
showers. So much did they do so, that when the new laborers, the sons
of the seraph Francisco arrived at the field, there was scarce an
island which had not produced most abundant fruit for the granaries of
the Church because of the work of the first sowers; as is shown in
several places of his history by father Fray Gasp&agrave;r de San
Agustin;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1373src" href="#xd0e1373">31</a> and
that lover of truth, father Fray Francisco de San Antonio confesses it,
thus honoring as he ought the Augustinian Hiermo [<i>sic</i>]. The
island of Mind&ograve;ro also shared in this good fortune. In its
cultivation were employed fathers Fray Francisco de Ort&egrave;ga and
Fray Diego de M&ograve;xica. They, after having founded the village of
B&agrave;co, endured innumerable misfortunes in a painful captivity,
hoping for hours for that death, which they anxiously desired in order
to beautify their heads with a painful martyrdom. But in order that one
might see that although the former worked above their strength, much
remained to be done by their successors, I shall cite here the exact
words of father Fray Gaspar de San Agustin in his <i lang="es">
Historia</i>. &ldquo;The convent,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb163" href="#pb163">163</a>]</span>he says, &ldquo;that we had in
that island [of Mind&ograve;ro: <i>added by Assis</i>] was in the
village of B&agrave;co. Thence the religious went out to minister to
the converted natives. The latter were very few and the religious
suffered innumerable hardships because of the roughness of the roads
and the bad climate of some regions.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1390src" href="#xd0e1390">32</a></p>

<p>789. The discalced sons of St. Francis (minors for their humility,
but greatest [<i lang="es">maximos</i>] by the fires which they could
cast from themselves in order to burn up the world) arrived in Manila
in the year 1577. Thence like flying clouds, whose centers were filled
with very active volcanoes, they were scattered through various parts
of the islands. They were received with innumerable applauses of their
inhabitants, who regarded them as persons who despised the riches of
earth, and thought only of filling the vacant seats of glory. One of
the places where their zeal for the salvation of souls was predominant
was the land of Mind&ograve;ro which had been ceded by the calced
Augustinian fathers. There, not being content with what had been
reduced, they extended the lights of the Catholic faith at the expense
of great efforts, in the direction of Pola and Calav&igrave;te. Those
who labored most in those places to communicate the infinite blessing
to souls were fathers Fray Estevan Ort&igrave;z and Fray Juan de
Porras, who were great leaders among the first religious of the
seraphic discalced order who went to Philipinas.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1398src" href="#xd0e1398">33</a> But since the fire is kept up in
matter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href=
"#pb164">164</a>]</span>in proportion as it abounds in commensurate
inclinations, various fields having been discovered in other parts
which were full of combustible dry fuel most fitting to receive the
heat of charity, which gives light to the beautiful body of the faith;
and seeing that that rational fuel of Mind&ograve;ro would not allow
themselves to be burned for their good, with the quickness that was
desired: they thought it advisable to abandon the little for the much,
and to go first to Il&ograve;cos and secondly to Camarines where they
hoped for more abundant fruits in return for their holy zeal.</p>

<p>790. In the year 1580 the religious of the holy Society of Jesus
arrived at the islands. They, in the manner of swift angels ennobling
and glorifying those hidden plains, expanded the habitation of Japhet,
in order that he might possess the famous tents of Shem. Immediately,
or very near the beginning, the superior detached excellent soldiers of
that spiritual troop for the island of Mind&ograve;ro, so that they
might with the arms of the preaching destroy the altars dedicated to
Belial by giving roots to the healthgiving sign of the cross. They
obtained much; for after having penetrated the roughest mountains in
search of heathens and Cimarrones they founded the village of
Naoj&agrave;n, with some other villages annexed to it. They enjoyed
that ministry a long time with their accustomed success. The one who
excelled in the missions of that island was Father Luis de Sanvictores,
whose glorious memory and reputation for sanctity was conserved for
many years among those Indians. They, notwithstanding the rudeness of
their style, never spoke of him without praise. But that father having
retired in order <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href=
"#pb165">165</a>]</span>to begin the conquest of the islands of
Ladrones (which were afterward called Marianas), where he with glorious
martyrdom gave the utmost encouragement, although others followed his
attempts in Mind&ograve;ro with great zeal; the Society finally
abandoned that island into the hands of the archbishop.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd0e1413src" href="#xd0e1413">34</a> We cannot give the
exact time of their resolution or the reasons which could move so
zealous fathers to it, although we regard it as certain that they did
it in order to employ themselves in other places where the evangelical
fruit was more plentiful.</p>

<p>791. His Excellency the prelate immediately formed two curacies of
the entire island, which he handed over to the secular clergy so that
they might aid those souls. Later as the two could not fulfil that, a
third cura had to be appointed. They carefully maintained what had been
conquered, a territory that included the coasts along the north side
extending from Bongabong to Calav&igrave;te. But because there were
very few Christians, since it is apparent that they did not exceed four
thousand, who were scattered throughout various settlements or
collections of huts along a distance of eighty leguas of coast, it was
not to be supposed that those missions would produce enough income for
three ministers. Consequently, they had necessarily to be aided with
other incomes, which were solicited from the royal treasury, and with
other pious foundations. Neither was that enough, so that at times it
was very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166">166</a>]</span>difficult to find seculars to take charge of
those districts. Those ministries were, it is true, scarce desirable,
both because of the smallness of their stipends, because they carried
with them unendurable hardships, and because of the unhealthfulness of
the territory. But finally, moved, either by charity or by obedience,
there was never a lack of zealous seculars who hastened with the bread
of the instruction to those Indians. The curacies were consequently
maintained there until the year 1679, when our discalced order took
charge of the whole island for reasons which we shall now relate.</p>

<p><i>Being obliged to abandon the ministries of Zamb&agrave;les by
force, our province of Philipinas assumes possession of the ministries
of Mind&ograve;ro, and obtains rare fruit with its preaching.</i></p>

<p>792. In the year 1606, that grain of mustard arrived in
Man&igrave;la, and although it was small, it produced the tree of most
surpassing magnitude. I speak of our first mission which was composed
at its arrival of a small number of religious. By preaching the glory
of God and announcing the works of His power, so few men founded the
greatness of that holy province among the illuminations of blind
heathenism. It cannot be denied that by that time the sound of the word
of God had reached all the Philipinas Islands, which had been announced
by the illustrious champions who had preceded us in that vast
archipelago, to wit, the calced Augustinians, the discalced
Franciscans, the Jesuits and the Dominicans. But there cannot be any
doubt either that, notwithstanding that all the above orders <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>had worked
in the conversion of souls, with the most heroic fervor, some new
locations in which they could enter to work were not lacking to Ours.
The harvest was great and the laborers few; and since, however much
those destined for that cultivation sweated in continual tenacity, they
could not go beyond the limited sphere of man, hence it is that the
Recollects on reaching that great vineyard at the hour of nine, equaled
in merit those who gained their day&rsquo;s wages from the first hour.
And in truth this will appear evident if one considers that even now,
after so many years in which the sacerdotal tuba of the apostolic
ministry has been incessantly exercised, not a few places are found in
the said islands where the individuals of all orders are employed in
living missions, and struggle with the most obstinate paganism.</p>

<p>793. The district where Ours first spread the gospel net was in the
mountain range called Zamb&agrave;les, in the middle part of which
extending from Mariv&egrave;les to Bolin&agrave;o they obtained fish in
great numbers, as has been told already in the preceding volumes. Those
villages of Zamb&agrave;les are located between ministries of the
reverend Dominican fathers. For, since the latter held along the great
bay of Man&igrave;la on the side called El Partido almost at the foot
of Mount Bat&agrave;n, several missions contiguous to Mariv&egrave;les
and on the other side of Bolin&agrave;o, the best portion of the
alcaldeship of Pangasin&agrave;n, they also included in their midst the
settlements of the Zambals now reduced to a Christian and civilized
life by the missionaries of the Augustinian reformed order. For that
reason the Dominicans had desired and even claimed without going beyond
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>the
boundaries dictated by courtesy and good relationship that our prelates
yield that territory to them, as it was suitable for the communication
of the Dominicans among themselves between Pangasin&agrave;n and
Man&igrave;la and would make their visits less arduous. But since that
was a very painful proposition to those who governed our discalced
order, namely, the abandonment of certain Indians who were the
firstborn of their spirit, and a land watered by the blood of so many
martyrs, the claim could never be made effectual, however much it was
smoothed over by the name of exchange, our province being offered other
ministries, in which was shown clearly the zeal of its individual
members.</p>

<p>794. The one who made the greatest efforts in this direction was
father Fray Phelipe Pardo, both times that he held the Dominican
provincialate in the years 1662 and 1673. Although all of his efforts
were then frustrated, he obtained great headway by them to obtain his
purposes later. For May 30, 1676, his Majesty presented him for the
office of archbishop of Man&igrave;la. Thereupon he formed the notion
that the new marks of the ecclesiastical dignity would be sufficient to
add authority to argument. For, because of the respect to his person,
surely worthy of the greatest promotion, we did not dare to condemn his
attempt as unjust; and more even, when he obtained it, making amends to
our reformed order for the wrong we received by a recompense which was
fully justifiable in his eyes. A chance offered him a suitable occasion
for his project in the following manner. Don Diego de Villatoro
represented to the Council of the Indias that the island of
Mind&ograve;ro was filled with innumerable <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb169" href="#pb169">169</a>]</span>heathens all sunk in the
darkness of their paganism; and that if its conquest were entrusted to
any order, it would be very easy to illumine its inhabitants with the
light of the faith. Therefore a royal decree was despatched, under date
of Madrid, June 18, 1677, ordering the governor of the islands,
together with the archbishop, to entrust the reduction of
Mind&ograve;ro to the order which appeared best fitted for it, before
all things settling the curas who resided there in prebends or
chaplaincies. That decree was presented to the royal Audiencia of
Man&igrave;la by Sargento-mayor Don Sebastian de Villarreal, October
31, 78, and since his Majesty&rsquo;s fiscal had nothing to oppose, it
was obeyed without delay, and it was sent for fulfilment to the said
archbishop, December 14 of the same year. On that account, his
Excellency formed the idea of taking Zamb&agrave;les from us in order
to augment his order and give the island of Mind&ograve;ro to our
discalced order.</p>

<p>795. He began, then, to discuss the matter without the loss of any
time, and he did not stop until his designs were obtained,
notwithstanding that he had to conquer innumerable difficulties. For,
in the first place, our provincial, then father Fray Joseph de San
Nicol&agrave;s, opposed it very strongly. The latter alleged that it
would be a violation of the municipal constitutions of the Recollects
to abandon the ministries of Zamb&agrave;les, for the constitutions
expressly stated that none of the convents once possessed should be
abandoned except under certain conditions, which were not present in
the case under consideration. Besides that the Indian natives of
Mind&ograve;ro, both Christians and infidels, scarcely knew that there
was a question of giving them minister <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb170" href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>religious and begged Jesuit
fathers with great instance, for they preserved yet the affection that
they had conceived for them, since the time that the latter had
procured for them with their preaching at the cost of many dangers
their greatest welfare, omitting no means that could conduce to their
withdrawal from the darkness of their paganism. And when the Zambals
heard that the Recollect fathers were to be taken from their villages,
in order to surrender them to the Dominicans, they declared almost in
violent uproar that they would not allow such a change under any
consideration, for they were unable to tolerate, because of the love
which they professed for their spiritual ministers, to be forever
deprived of their company, by which they had obtained so great progress
in the Catholic faith.</p>

<p>796. But the archbishop found means in the hidden recesses of his
prudence by which to conquer such obstacles. For in unison with Don
Juan de Vargas Hurtado, governor and captain-general of the islands, he
softened the provincial, Fray Joseph de San Nicol&agrave;s, and obliged
him to agree to the exchange. He quieted the natives of Mind&ograve;ro
by means of their corregidor, so that they might receive the ministers
of our discalced order, and availing himself of the services of the
alcalde-mayor of Pangasin&agrave;n, he silenced the Zambal Indians so
that they should take the privation of their Recollects gracefully, and
lower the head to the admission of the Dominican fathers. Thereupon,
the sea of opposition having been calmed, and after the three seculars
who were administering to Mind&ograve;ro had been assigned fitting
competencies, which were provided <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171"
href="#pb171">171</a>]</span>for them in Man&igrave;la, an act of the
royal Audiencia provided that our reformed order should be entrusted
with the administration of the said island, with absolute clauses which
established it in the said royal decree, and without the least respect
the abandonment of the Zambal missions. Then immediately preceding the
juridical surrender of them, which was signed by the above-mentioned
father provincial, although it was protested by only the father lector,
Fray Joseph de la Assumpcion, and father Fray Francisco de la Madre de
Dios, a second act was passed by which the missions were assigned to
the fathers of St. Dominic. Thus did the archbishop have a complete
victory.</p>

<p>797. By virtue of those decrees, which were announced to our
provincial, April 17, 1679, that holy province was dispossessed of all
the Zambal mountain range, which then contained eleven villages. They
were also dispossessed of the missions which father Fray Joseph de la
Trinidad was then fomenting in the nearby mountains by the far-reaching
fruits of his apostolic preaching, as we have mentioned worthily in
another place.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1452src" href=
"#xd0e1452">35</a> The individual members of the province of Santo
Rosario hastened to take charge of the ministries and missions of the
Zambals which had been surrendered to them by Ours without the least
disturbance being observed publicly, although almost all of those
governed by the said Father Trinidad threatened violence. Those
juridical measures, with what was done in Man&igrave;la, served much
later for the recovery of Zamb&agrave;les without the loss of the new
possessions of Mind&ograve;ro. The necessary papers <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>were also
despatched directed to the corregidor of Mind&ograve;ro, ordering him
to deliver the ministries of that island to the discalced Augustinians.
Without loss of time, the father definitor, Fray Diego de la Madre de
Dios, assumed charge of the district of B&agrave;co, while the bachelor
Don Joseph de Roxas who possessed it left it. The curacy of
Calav&igrave;te was taken possession of by father Fray Diego de la
Resurreccion, who took the place of Licentiate Don Juan Pedrosa. The
parish of Naoy&agrave;n was taken charge of by the father definitor,
Fray Eugenio de los Santos, the bachelor, Don Martin Diaz, being
removed. All that was concluded before the end of the year 1679 without
disturbance, lawsuits, or dissensions.</p>

<p>798. The above-mentioned religious were accompanied by three others
of whose names we are ignorant. Immediately did that holy squadron
commence to announce the testimony of Christ, with sermons founded on
the manifestation of virtue, spirit, and example, and not on illusory
persuasion which is built on naught but words, which are confirmatory
of human wisdom. They considered especially that they had to give
strict account of those souls whose direction had just been given them.
Consequently, they watched over their flock, hastening to their sheep
with the right food, without avoiding the greatest fatigue. Hence could
one recognize the great good fortune of the island of Mind&ograve;ro,
for in the territory where three seculars at most, and generally only
two, lived formerly, six evangelical laborers had enough to do. They
were later increased to eight, and that number was never or but rarely
decreased. Each of them on his part <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb173" href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>produced most abundant fruits at
that time, and under all circumstances the same has been obtained. For
although the common enemy diffused much discord during the first tasks
of their apostolic labor in order thereby to choke the pure grain of
the divine word by making use therefor of a man, namely, Admiral Don
Joseph de Chaves, encomendero of almost the entire island, at last by
Ours exercising their innate prudence and their unalterable patience,
the grace of God was triumphant, while the attempts of Satan were a
mockery.</p>

<p>799. Father Fray Juan Francisco de San Antonio remarked very
forcibly of our discalced religious that, &ldquo;although they were the
last gospel laborers in Philipinas, they have competed in their
apostolic zeal with the first laborers in the fruits that they gathered
from their labors in the reduction of the most barbarous
islanders.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1466src" href=
"#xd0e1466">36</a> And the father master, Fray Joseph Sicardo, adds
very fittingly, that &ldquo;our discalced religious having received the
great island of Mind&ograve;ro, increased the Christianity of its
natives by means of so zealous ministers.<span class="corr" id=
"xd0e1469" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span><a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1471src" href="#xd0e1471">37</a> Then, as appears from juridical
instruments before me, although the Christians throughout the island
when our reformed order assumed charge of it did not exceed four
thousand, in the year 1692 they already exceeded the number of eight
thousand, and in the year 1716 arrived to the number of twelve
thousand. It is a fact that the persecution by the Moros happening
afterward (of which something was said <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb174" href="#pb174">174</a>]</span>incidentally in volume three,<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e1479src" href="#xd0e1479">38</a> and which will
in due time add much to this history) the number of believers was
greatly lessened; for some retired to other islands, where the war was
not so cruel, others were taken to Jol&ograve; in dire captivity, and
others surrendered their lives to so great a weight of misfortune.
Notwithstanding that, in the year 1738, when father Fray Juan Francisco
de San Antonio printed his first volume, it appeared by trustworthy
documents that Ours administered seven thousand five hundred and
fifty-two souls in the various villages, visitas, missions, and
rancher&iacute;as in that island.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1482src"
href="#xd0e1482">39</a> Hence, one may infer that our zealous brothers
have labored there especially in destroying paganism and reducing the
many Zimarr&ograve;nes or apostates who, having thrown off all
obedience, had built themselves forts in those mountains. And if not
few of both classes remain obstinate, it does not proceed certainly
from any omission that has been found in our zealous workers, but from
other causes which are already suggested in other parts of this present
volume.</p>

<p>800. Neither can one make from this progress of the Catholic faith
which was attained by the preaching of our religious, any inferences
against the other laborers who began to subdue the island, or against
the secular clergy, who administered it afterward. The Observant
fathers, as a rule, employed there no more than one missionary or at
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href=
"#pb175">175</a>]</span>most two. The number of the fathers of St.
Francis was no larger, and they had charge at times of the district of
Balay&agrave;n as well as of Mind&ograve;ro. Since the fathers of the
Society had so much to attend to in so many parts, two or three of them
took care of Mind&ograve;ro and Marinduque. Consequently, one ought not
to be surprised that so small a number of laborers did not do more,
but, that they had done so much must surely astonish him who considers
it thoroughly. In the same way the parish priests, who succeeded them,
were very few, and since the reduced Indians occupied so extensive a
coast, they had scarce enough time to administer the bread of the
doctrine to the Christians, so that they had none left to penetrate
into the mountains in search of the Zimarrones or of the heathen
Mangui&agrave;nes.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1492src" href=
"#xd0e1492">40</a> But, on the contrary, from the time that that island
was delivered to our teaching, the number of missionaries has been
doubled or tripled. It is evident that victories must generally
increase in proportion to the increase of the soldiers in the campaign,
even in what concerns spiritual wars.</p>

<p>801. This argument has more force, if it be considered that the
evangelical laborers having increased afterward with so great profit,
they asserted that at times the greatest strength accompanied by
gigantic zeal was given up as conquered, by the continual toil
indispensable in the administration of the faithful, for to that task
was added the care of the conversion of the heathen. That toil was so
excessive that the night generally came without the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>fathers having
obtained a moment of rest in order to pay the debt of the divine
office. At times they had to neglect the care of their own bodies in
order to attend to the souls of their neighbors. They were always
busied in teaching the instruction to children and adults; in
administering the holy sacraments, although they had to go three or
four leguas to the places where the dying persons were; and in
penetrating the rough mountains in the center of the island, in order
to allure the heathens and apostates to the healthful bosom of the
Church. To all the above (which even now is, as it were, a common
characteristic of all our missionaries in Philipinas) is added the
extreme poverty there, and the lack of necessities that they endured.
For, the reduced product from those villages, in regard to the
ecclesiastical stipend, which was formerly insufficient to support two
or three curas with great misery, was now sufficient to support six or
more religious. Consequently, they endured it with the greatest
hardship.</p>

<h5 class="normal">&sect; III</h5>

<p><i>Information of the convents which were founded in that island,
and the miracles with which God confirmed the Catholic religion which
Ours were preaching.</i></p>

<p>802. Trampling under foot, then, the above discomforts and others
which are omitted, those illustrious champions attended to the exact
fulfilment of the spiritual administration, employing themselves in the
exercise of missionaries in order to reduce the heathens to the
Catholic sheepfold. In the belief that it would be very conducive to
the extension of the Christian religion to establish convents in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>new
territory which they were cultivating, they began to set their hands to
the work. The first foundation which they established was in the
village of B&agrave;co, where the corregidor was residing at that time,
although that convent was later moved to Calap&agrave;n. Two religious
were placed there in residence, and they looked after the spiritual
administration in several rancher&iacute;as. Those rancher&iacute;as
have increased with the lapse of time to a great number of Christians,
and have become villages that are not to be despised, having been
formed anew by the zeal of our apostolic laborers. The villages
comprehended in that district in the year 1733 are the following:
Calap&agrave;n, which is the chief one, where the convent is located;
B&agrave;co, Sub&agrave;n, Ilog, Min&ograve;lo, and Camor&ograve;n,
which are annexed villages or visitas, as they are called there. Our
church of Calap&agrave;n is enriched with an image of Christ our Lord,
which represents Him in His infancy; and on that account it is called
the convent of Santo Ni&ntilde;o [<i>i.e.</i>, Holy Child]. That image
is conspicuous in continual miracles and is the consolation of all the
Indians of Mind&ograve;ro. For a long history might be written by only
relating the marvels which the divine power has worked by it; now
giving health to many sick unto death; now freeing villages from
locusts which were destroying the fields, now succoring not a few boats
which driven by violent storms were running down the Marinduque coast,
whose sailors were in the greatest danger of being drowned in the
water, or the ship of grounding on the shoals of the land.</p>

<p>803. [One miracle is related of a Recollect in Calap&agrave;n who
having acquired two hundred pesos determined to send it home to Spain
to his mother <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href=
"#pb178">178</a>]</span>who was very poor, without saying anything to
the provincial as he was in duty bound to do. Being very observant in
his outward duties, he said mass before the image just previous to
sending the money to America on a ship which appeared opportunely, but
the image turned its back on him. Thereupon, being convicted of sin, he
burst into tears, and was thereafter free from such temptations.]</p>

<p>804. The above case happened years after when the convent was
established in Calap&agrave;n. Let us now examine other marvels, which
happened at B&agrave;co, near the beginning, which were of great use
for the extension of the Catholic name. The father definitor, Fray
Diego de la Madre de Dios, who was the founder of that house, was
surely a holy man, and was venerated as such in Man&igrave;la.
Notwithstanding that, however, a corregidor took to persecuting him by
word and deed. The servant of God bore the personal insults with great
patience, although it pained him to the soul to see that the
corregidor&rsquo;s contempt was resulting in prejudice to the Catholic
religion. He practiced several secret efforts ordered by charity in
order to restrain the corregidor&rsquo;s tongue, but seeing that they
were insufficient, generally chided in a sermon the evil employment of
sacrilegious mouths which, taking the gospel laborers as the object of
their detractions, prevent the fruit of their preaching, although they
should aid in the attainment of so holy an end. The chief culprit was
present, toward whom without naming him the father directed his aim;
and since, after one has once left the hand of God, he precipitates
himself easily from one abyss to another (angered by the pain which was
caused him by the medicine, which was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb179" href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>being applied prudently in order
to cure him of his pain and indiscreetly abusing the authority which
resided in his person), he rose in anger, with the determination to
impose silence on the father who (if he was talking) it was, for his
own [<i>i. e.</i>, the corregidor&rsquo;s] good. &ldquo;Sacrilegious
preacher&rdquo; he exclaimed, but when he attempted to continue his
face was suddenly twisted, and he could not utter a word, and he was
extremely disfigured and was attacked by most intense pains. He was
taken to his house, where the venerable father attended him, and by his
only making the sign of the cross above the corregidor&rsquo;s mouth
the patient was restored to his former state of health in body, while
in soul he was completely changed. The courage to make public penitence
for his public crimes, and to return his credit entirely to so holy a
religious did not fail him.</p>

<p>805. [The same father although very sick with fever did not
hesitate, aided by spiritual forces, to go to a distance to administer
to a sick person who had urgently requested his presence&mdash;a fact
that conduced not a little to the conversion of the natives round
about.]</p>

<p>806 [and 807]. The second convent was founded in the village of
Naoj&agrave;n by the father definitor, Fray Eugenio de los Santos, and
St. Nicholas of Tolentino was assigned it as titular. Besides the said
principal village, it had in its charge six annexed villages of
visitas, namely, P&ograve;la, Pinamalay&agrave;n, Balente,
Sum&agrave;gay, Maliguo, and Bong&agrave;bong. However, with the change
of the district of Mang&agrave;rin, of which we shall speak later,
there was some variation in the distribution of those settlements. That
ministry is one of the first in authority in the island, <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180">180</a>]</span>because of the
great number of parishioners to which it has increased, because a great
multitude of heathen Mangui&agrave;nes who have been converted to our
holy faith, have gone thither to live, as well as a not small number of
apostate Christians, who were wandering at liberty through those
mountains. All that was obtained by the preaching of our laborers by
whose efforts three of the said villages were re&euml;stablished. [Two
prodigies or miraculous occurrences which are related aided in the
christianizing of this convent.]</p>

<p>808 [and 809]. Another and third convent was established in the
convent of Calav&igrave;te by the efforts of father Fray Diego de la
Resurreccion, and its titular was Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Populo
[<i>i.e.</i>, Our Lady of the People]. It has the annexed villages of
D&ograve;ngon, Santa Cruz, Mamb&ugrave;rao, Tub&igrave;li, and Santo
Thom&agrave;s. Of those settlements, those that are on the coast which
extends from Calav&igrave;te to Mang&agrave;rin, have been founded for
the most part by dint of the zeal of our religious. They formerly had
many Christians, although at present they have suffered a remarkable
diminution because of the persecutions of the Moros which we have
already mentioned. [An epidemic that was raging throughout this
district when the convent was founded was checked miraculously. In the
same district, a heathen Manguian chief who had opposed the new faith
surrendered to the personal solicitation of Fray Diego de la
Resurreccion, and became a good Christian, and afterward aided in the
conversion of many others. The district was miraculously cleared of the
pest of locusts which were destroying all the fields.] <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181">181</a>]</span></p>

<p>810 [and 811]. The fourth convent was erected in the village of
Mang&agrave;rin under the advocacy of our father, St. Augustine. Its
prior also governed the villages of Gu&agrave;sig, Man&agrave;ol,
Il&igrave;lin, and Bulal&agrave;cao. However, the provincial chapter of
1737 ordered that house removed to Bong&agrave;bong, for reasons that
they considered most sufficient, namely, because Mang&agrave;rin was
ruined by the continual invasions of the Moros, and because of its poor
temperature, which put an end to the health of almost all the
religious. For that reason, the distribution of the annexed villages of
Naoj&agrave;n, Mang&agrave;rin, and Calav&igrave;te in another manner
was inevitable, so that the correct administration of the doctrina
might be more promptly administered. But the convents above mentioned
always were left standing, and serve as plazas de armas, where those
soldiers of Jesus take refuge in order to go out in the island to war
against the armies of Satan. It can be stated confidently that the
district of which we have been speaking, has been conquered by our
reformed order; for when we entered Mind&ograve;ro, scarcely was the
name of Christ known there, while at present there are many souls there
who follow the banners of the cross, and all the power of hell, incited
by Mahometan infidelity, has not availed to destroy the deep roots of
its faith. On the contrary we have wondered greatly at the power of the
divine grace in those neophytes, for after their belief has been proved
many times, as gold in the crucible, in the fire of the most raging
persecution it has gone up [a number of] carats in value and purity.
[This district was also the scene of a miracle or prodigy that showed
the force of God and the faith.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182"
href="#pb182">182</a>]</span></p>

<p>812. Besides the above-mentioned convents, a mission was begun some
years later in the mountains of Mind&ograve;ro for the purpose of
reducing the Mangui&agrave;nes heathen. Although many of them had been
converted, allured by the zeal of various religious, still not a few
remained in the darkness of paganism for lack of ministers, who could
busy themselves without any other occupation in busying themselves in
illumining them with the evangelical light. That was so abundant a
field that it could keep many laborers busy. Thus the project was
formed by the province to keep at least three subjects busy in it, so
that each one, so far as he might be able, might put his hand to the
plough, and without turning back, cultivate so extensive a land, which
was capable of producing an infinite amount of fruit for the table of
glory. But since the missionaries maintain themselves there at the cost
of the royal treasury, which is almost always in a state of too great
exhaustion, so well conceived a desire had to be satisfied with one
single preacher, whom the superior government assigned for that
purpose, although the province assigns others at its own expense, when
its too great poverty does not prevent, or the lack of men, so usual
there. The residence of those missionaries in the village of Ilog was
determined upon and a suitable convent was established there. From that
place, entering the mountains frequently, they began to fell their
rational thickets, in order to fertilize them with the waters of
irrigation of the divine grace, so that the seed of their apostolic
preaching might be received. By means of the laborious eagerness of the
sowers who have succeeded them, a great portion of that arid desert has
been transformed into the most charming garden. When I left Philipinas
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href=
"#pb183">183</a>]</span>the year 1738, it still existed as a most
fruitful mission and there were well founded hopes that if Apollos
water the plants established by Paul, it will receive the most abundant
increase from God.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1549src" href=
"#xd0e1549">41</a></p>

<p>813. [The way was blazed also in the mountain mission with
miraculous occurrences that proclaimed the true God.] It appears
impossible that their inhabitants should not come to know God and
should not run breathless after the odoriferous delicacias of His
goodness. There is still much to do in this regard, for a great number
of infidels still live in the said mountains, and if thirty
missionaries were assigned there, they would not lack employment. But
let us praise God for what has been accomplished, petitioning Him to
crown so memorable beginnings with a good end.</p>

<p>823. [The Recollect missionaries of Philipinas can rightly be called
apostolic because of their zeal.]</p>

<p>824. In the year 1661, the Chinese pirate Kuesing <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>sent an embassy
to the Philipinas Islands, demanding nothing less than the vassalage of
them all, and threatening the Spaniards who did not comply with what he
called their obligation that they would feel all the weight of war on
themselves. We have already treated of this matter in another place.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e1580src" href="#xd0e1580">42</a> So far as we
have to do with the matter here, various measures were taken in the
islands because of the fears caused by the threat, in order that they
might be defended in case that Kuesing fulfilled it. One of those
measures was the abandonment of the presidios of Terren&agrave;te,
Zambo&agrave;ngan, Calami&agrave;nes, and others, in order that they
might be able to employ their troops, artillery, and munitions of war
in defending the most important places. That decree was opposed very
strongly, but the objections although they were thoroughly based on
reason could not prevent such action being taken. Consequently, at the
end of 1662 or at the beginning of 63 the presidios were actually
withdrawn, and the Christian villages were left more exposed than ever
to the invasions of the Moros. That so fatal resolution was also
necessarily accompanied by the withdrawal of the evangelical ministers,
for the fathers of the Society abandoned Zambo&agrave;ngan and other
sites, and our Recollect family the Calami&agrave;nes. Although no
special regret was shown for that action at that time by the superior
government of Man&igrave;la, to whom belongs the duty of furnishing
spiritual ministers to the subject villages, yet years afterward the
wrong was recognized, and the remedy was procured in due manner.</p>

<p>825. The most fruitful preaching of Ours in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185">185</a>]</span>islands of
Calami&agrave;nes has been already related in volume II;<a class= 
"noteref" id="xd0e1590src" href="#xd0e1590">43</a> as has also the
conversion of their inhabitants, until then heathens; the marvels which
divine Omnipotence worked there; the convents which were established
for the extension of the Catholic faith; and the hardships endured by
the missionaries in spreading it. Now, then, it must be noted that
eight religious were well employed in all the islands of that
jurisdiction, who looked after the spiritual administration of the
Christian Indians and the conversion of the idolaters who were not few.
But when they withdrew, only two remained in charge of the islands of
Cuyo and Agut&agrave;ya while the six betook themselves to
Man&igrave;la or wherever their obedience assigned them. The place
occupied by the six (where they labored to excess, as there were many
Indians and they were spread out into many islands and settlements) was
given to one single secular priest. He having his residence in
Tayt&agrave;y, did as much as he was able in the other villages. But it
is more than certain that he could do very little, if he did perchance
succeed in doing anything. In this regard one can visibly see the
spiritual wrong which followed those vassals of the king. Even an
undeniable loss resulted to the royal treasury, for in a few years the
Indian tributes were lessened almost by half. But notwithstanding that,
neither Governor Don Diego de Salcedo nor the bishop of Zeb&ugrave;, to
whom it belonged in its various aspects to supply the remedy of one and
the other wrong, would manifest that they understood it.</p>

<p>826. Thus did things go on for seventeen years <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186">186</a>]</span>until the year
1680, when the Indian chiefs of Calami&agrave;nes having united among
themselves, presented a memorial to Governor Don Juan de Bargas
Hurtado. In it, after mentioning the wrongs above mentioned, and the
love which they always professed to our religious, their first
ministers, they urgently petitioned that the Augustinian Recollects be
assigned them as parish priests. The fact that the cura, Don Antonio de
Figuer&ograve;a, the only missionary in Calami&agrave;nes, in addition
to having been presented for the curacy of Tab&ugrave;co in the
archbishopric of Man&igrave;la, had now been sick for two months and
unable to administer the sacraments, lent force to that representation.
On that account he petitioned with double justice that a successor be
sent to him, but no secular ecclesiastic could be found who knew the
language of the country, nor would risk the mission which was now of
but very small profit. For those reasons, the abovesaid governor
despatched an order to our provincial on May 11 of the said year,
asking and charging him, and even ordering him in the king&rsquo;s
name, to assign religious of his order, in order that they might go to
reassume possession of the villages of Calami&agrave;nes, so that they
might attend to its spiritual administration. He hoped that by means of
their wonted zeal, that province would be restored to its former
splendor through their direction and teaching, and that the number of
the Christians would increase in the proportion desired.</p>

<p>827. But notwithstanding that, the father provincial negotiated with
his definitory in order to interpose a supplication in regard to the
said act, and refused to send evangelical laborers, the total cause of
such action being the lack of religious. He <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb187" href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>alleged, then, that since his
province had assumed charge of the ministries of the Contracosta and of
Mind&ograve;ro, where many subjects were employed; and in consideration
of the lack of men which the discalced order suffered there, which
could not be helped: not only was it clearly impossible for him to
assign missionaries to Calami&agrave;nes, but also that he saw that it
was necessary for the reformed branch to reiterate his petition made
previously to the royal Audiencia, in regard to withdrawing the two
ministers who were occupied in the island of C&ugrave;yo, as there was
a notable lack in other villages. That allegation was sent by decree of
the superior government to Don Diego Antonio de Viga, of the Council of
his Majesty and his fiscal in the Audiencia of Man&igrave;la. On the
sixteenth of the same month and year, he maintained that
notwithstanding the representation made by the father provincial (since
no other order contained ministers who understood the language of the
Calami&agrave;nes), the necessary provision must be despatched, in
accordance with the second and last warning, ordering the Recollect
province to establish missionaries in Calami&agrave;nes and not to
withdraw those of C&ugrave;yo. He was confident in the apostolic zeal
with which they have ever applied themselves to the ministry, that
notwithstanding their small number they would accomplish the task which
demanded many laborers.</p>

<p>828. The governor conformed to the plea of the fiscal. Consequently,
on the same day he despatched in due form a second decree in the
king&rsquo;s name, ordering the superior prelate of our province, in
consideration of the extreme necessity of the islands of
Calami&agrave;nes, to immediately establish the necessary <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>ministers therein
for the spiritual consolation of those Indians. He added that Don Fray
Diego de Aguilar of the Order of Preachers, the bishop recently
appointed for Zeb&ugrave; (to whose miter the said islands belonged)
despatched ex-officio his decree also charging our province with the
administration of all the Christian villages established in
Calami&agrave;nes, or that were to be established in the future; and
says that he does so in consideration of the apostolic zeal of our
reformed order and the spirit that always assists them in trampling
under foot the greatest fatigues, so that many souls might be gathered
into the flock of the Catholic church. Thereupon the father provincial,
Fray Thom&agrave;s de San Geronimo, could offer no more resistance and
sent father Fray Nicol&agrave;s de Santa Ana as vicar-provincial of
Calami&agrave;nes, with two associates. The alcalde-mayor of the said
province, Don Diego Bibi&egrave;n Henriquez, placed them in possession
of the ministry of Tayt&agrave;y (which is the chief one of them all)
on the first of November, 1680, to the universal joy of the Indians.
The latter showed by extraordinary festivals their joy at seeing that
the direction of their spirits was in charge of the same fathers who
had engendered them through the gospel. The king, by his decree dated
December 24, 1682, confirmed the said possession at the petition of the
father commissary of Philipinas, Fray Juan de la Madre de Dios, with
great signs of his royal pleasure.</p>

<p>829. Of the three religious newly assigned, father Fray
Nicol&agrave;s established his residence in Tayt&agrave;y; the second
was located in the island of Dumar&agrave;n; and the third in the
village of Tanc&ograve;n. From those places they labored according to
their strength, until <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href=
"#pb189">189</a>]</span>the arrival at Philipinas of the band of
missionaries which was conducted by the father commissary, Fray Juan de
la Madre de Dios, which entered Man&igrave;la in October 1684, when a
greater number of missionaries could be assigned, as was very necessary
for the direction of so many Indians. For the extensive territory which
was formerly administered by only one cura, has later given worthy
employment to five, six, or seven of our religious, to say nothing of
the two at the least, who have been stationed continually in the
islands of C&ugrave;yo. Hence one may infer how much the Catholic faith
has been extended there, now by reducing into the villages the many
natives who had fled to the mountains, after abandoning almost entirely
their Christian obligations; now by undeceiving others who lack but
little of becoming Moros, because of their nearness and intercourse
with those people; and now by penetrating into the roughest mountains
of Par&agrave;gua in order to draw the souls from the darkness of
paganism to the agreeable light of the Christian religion.</p>

<p>830. In regard to these particulars, we consider it necessary to
reproduce at this point a portion of a letter written May 28, 1683, to
our father vicar-general, Fray Juan de la Presentacion, by the
recently-elected father provincial of those islands, Fray Isidoro de
Jesus Maria, a person well known in Europa for the literary productions
which he has published. He speaks, then, as follows: &ldquo;The urgings
of the Indians of the province of Calami&agrave;nes to the
ecclesiastical and secular government and to my predecessors, have
availed so much, that this province has judged that the precept of
Christian charity demands us to return to that administration, trusting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190">190</a>]</span>in
God our Lord for the relief of the very great disadvantages which had
compelled our religious who had administered and reared that field of
Christendom from its beginning, to withdraw from that province. At the
present it has increased by more than two thousand souls who have been
drawn from the mountains in less than three years, as can be seen from
the relations sent to the chapter. Greater fruits are hoped for,
because in the past year of 82, the ambassador of the king of Borney in
the name of his prince, arranged with the governor of these islands for
the cession of a not small amount of land and number of settlements,
which are subject to the said Born&egrave;y&mdash;one in the island of
Par&agrave;gua, one of the islands of Calami&agrave;nes. The
confirmation of the pact with his ambassador is awaited from
Born&egrave;y, so that that district may really be incorporated with
the rest which is subject to the king our sovereign; and consequently,
to introduce by means of our religious, the Catholic faith among those
new vassals of his Majesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>831. Then he goes on to treat of the unsupportable hardships
suffered in Calami&agrave;nes by the evangelical ministers. I have
thought it best not to omit his relation, in order that one may see how
much merit is acquired in the promulgation of the faith amid such
anxieties. &ldquo;But the devil,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;who
watches that he may not lose the souls of which he finds himself in <i>
quasi</i> possession, has raised up at this time a cloud of dust, by
which he has prevented and is preventing in many of these remote parts
the obtaining of many souls and is occasioning the loss of others. For
as I am advised by the letters of the religious of Calami&agrave;nes,
under date of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href=
"#pb191">191</a>]</span>eighteenth of the current month and of the
twenty-second of the past month of April, that the alcaldes-mayor who
have governed that jurisdiction (and even more he who is governing it
at present, who is a lad of 21, a servant of the governor and of these
islands) cause so great and continual troubles both to the father
ministers and to the natives of the country, that the latter, although
Christians, have retired from their villages of Tayt&agrave;y,
Dumar&agrave;n, and Par&agrave;gua to the mountains in order to escape
their intolerable oppression. They exclaim that they are not
withdrawing from obedience to his Majesty and that they do not intend
to abandon their profession as Christians, but that they do not dare to
live in the more than enslaved condition in which the alcaldes-mayor,
carried away by their insatiable greed, confine them. The father prior
of Tayt&agrave;y writes me that he has entered the mountains with every
danger from the enemy, in search of his terrified and scattered sheep;
and notwithstanding all the efforts and warnings that he has made and
given them he has not been able to succeed in getting them to return to
their villages, unless another alcalde-mayor be assigned to them, and
relief offered for the extreme oppression that is offered to them. They
answer the arguments of the father by telling him not to tire himself,
&lsquo;for we can ill hope,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;that he who
tramples on the sacred dignity of a priest, will have any moderation
with regard to us.&rsquo; They assert this because they saw that the
last alcalde-mayor lifted his cane against father Fray Domingo de San
Agustin, and struck him while he was putting on his clerical robes to
say mass; and that the present alcalde-mayor treated the religious with
indignity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href=
"#pb192">192</a>]</span>even to the point of taking from them the one
who takes them their necessary support, so that they have had to find
for themselves the water that they drink. He has taken from them the
sacristans and other servants of the Church without leaving them even
anyone to aid them in the mass. He has forbidden the Indians to enter
the convent or to assist in any of the things to which they are
obliged. He has forbidden them to go out as they ought to the visitas,
and to confess, preach, and catechize. It is all directed to the end
that the Indians might not be busied in anything else than in getting
wax for the alcalde-mayor. Hence this is the source and beginning of
the troubles suffered by the poor Indians. They are not only not
permitted to make use of their natural right, but are prevented from
giving the due execution to his Majesty&rsquo;s orders, from entering
and going out, from trading and trafficking one with another, and one
village with another, for if they have anything to buy or to sell, it
must be entirely for the alcalde-mayor. These notices are necessarily
communicated in the lands of the infidels. Just consider, your
Reverence, what will be the condition of their minds, when we try to
reduce them to the knowledge of our good God, and to the obedience of
the king our sovereign. I have informed the governor in regard to this,
and since I do not expect any relief from his hand, I entreat your
Reverence to procure it from the royal piety with the memorial and
documents adjoined. If not we shall have to appeal to God, for such
troubles are of very frequent occurrence in various parts of these
islands. We never cease to wonder when we see some Spaniards here who
are so destitute of Christian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193"
href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>considerations, and so clothed in greed,
God so permitting by His lofty judgments, in exchange for the
martyrdoms that are lacking to us religious in Jap&ograve;n.&rdquo;</p>

<p>832. We believe, although we are not altogether sure, that the
suitable relief was given on one and the other side, for in the
following years, we find that the Catholic faith made very
extraordinary gains in Calami&agrave;nes. This is proved by the
re&euml;stablishment of the ancient convents and ministries. It appears
that the chapter of 1686 erected a new mission in the village of
Tanc&ograve;n which was later moved to the village of Culi&ograve;n.
The chapter of 1695 established another distinct mission in the island
of Dumar&agrave;n, and that of 1698 a third one in the island of
Lincap&agrave;n; and we see that that of 1746 has added two other
ministries, the first in the island of Alutaya, and the second in the
village of Calat&agrave;n. That is sure proof of the increase of the
Christians, when the evangelical laborers are so increased. In regard
to the above we must mention what appears from acts and judicial
reports which the superior government of Man&igrave;la sent to the
Council of the Indias, and which are conserved in its secretary&rsquo;s
office in the department of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a; namely, that when our
province of Calami&agrave;nes was again given to us, all the islands
contained only 4,500 Christian souls, but that in the year 1715 they
amounted to 18,600. And even after the continual and furious
persecution, which is mentioned briefly in the third volume<a class= 
"noteref" id="xd0e1626src" href="#xd0e1626">44</a> had intervened, with
which it is undeniable that the number of believers had decreased
greatly, father Fray Juan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href= 
"#pb194">194</a>]</span>Francisco de San Antonio notes in the history
of his province of San Gregorio de Philipinas<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1631src" href="#xd0e1631">45</a> that there were 21,076 Christian
souls in the islands of Calami&agrave;nes and Rombl&ograve;n in the
year 1735. Hence subtracting about five thousand from that number for
those of the island of Rombl&ograve;n, there is a remainder of about
sixteen thousand for Calami&agrave;nes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1634src" href="#xd0e1634">46</a> Let us give praises to God who
thus maintains the zeal of those fervent laborers and crowns their
fatigues with so abundant fruits.</p>

<p>[Section ii of this chapter mentions the virtues and holiness of
some of the Indians of the missions of Calami&agrave;nes. The first
mentioned was one Joseph Bagumb&agrave;yan, a native of Tayt&agrave;y,
who was reared in the convent of that village by the Recollects. The
rearing of such children is described as follows: &ldquo;The holy
orders of Philipinas are wont to take account of the sons of the chief
Indians of the villages under their charge, in order to teach them
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195">195</a>]</span>good
morals from childhood, and rear them with those qualities which are
considered necessary to enable them to govern their respective villages
afterward with success, since the administration of justice is always
put in charge of such Indians. They live in the convents from childhood
in charge of the gravest fathers. The latter are called masters,
although in strictness they are tutors or teachers who would right
gladly avoid such service. In this meaning, and in no other, must one
understand whatever is said about our religious having servants in the
Philipinas. I have heard scruples expressed here in Espa&ntilde;a over
this bare kind [of service], when it ought to be a matter for
edification to see that in addition to the truly gigantic toils that
our brothers there load upon their shoulders, they voluntarily take
this very troublesome one of rearing a few children who serve only to
exercise the patience.&rdquo; Joseph strove to imitate the fathers as
much as possible, in self sacrifice and austerity, and desired to
become a donn&eacute;, &ldquo;which was the most to which he could
aspire, since he was only an Indian.&rdquo; That, however, being denied
him, he was enrolled in the confraternity of the Correa or girdle, and
admitted as a spiritual brother of the Recollect order. He acted as
teacher of boys for over fifty years, teaching them reading, writing,
arithmetic, and music. At his death he was buried in the Recollect
church at Tayt&agrave;y. One of the boys taught by Joseph was
Bartolom&egrave; Ling&ograve;n. At the age of fifteen he was appointed
to assist Fray Alonso de San Agustin or Garcias, who arrived in
Philipinas in 1684 and was sent immediately to Calami&agrave;nes.
Although he desired to remain unmarried, he was married at the request
of the missionaries to a devout woman named Magdalena <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>Il&igrave;ng. He
acted as the chief sacristan of the Recollect church in Tayt&agrave;y,
ever taking great delight in the service of the church and his duties
therein. He survived his wife three years, dying in January 1696. His
wife had been born in Laguna de Par&agrave;gua but had lived in
Tayt&agrave;y most of her life with a Christian aunt. Although she
wished to devote her life exclusively to religion she was persuaded by
the religious to marry Bartolom&egrave;. Her devotion led her to teach
the girls of the village without pay. Of a gentle disposition she was
yet unyielding on occasions of necessity and although tempted by an
alcalde-mayor who was enamored of her beauty and made improper
proposals to her, she ever maintained her virtue. At her death by
cancer of the breast, she was buried in the Recollect church. The last

ports to all missionaries in 1640, the Philippine Recollects began to
work up the foreign mission field, but it was not until 1650 that they
were able to present memorials to the Roman court, which proved
unavailing as the Italians and French were already on the ground in
many of the Asiatic countries. In 1667 the father provincial, Fray Juan
de la Madre de Dios, received decrees in blank ordering him to send
laborers to China, but the royal treasury was in no position to aid
them, and the wars both in the islands and in China also prevented the
proposed spiritual invasion. Many other mandatory decrees from the king
met the same fate, but in the chapter of 1680, the order determined to
make the mission if they had to supply all the funds themselves. Three
men were told off to study the language in order to prepare for the
work in China, and in 1682, one did actually get as far as Macan, but
the opposition of the civil authorities there proved the deathknell to
all hopes at that time. Again in 1701, and in 1704, abortive attempts
were made to enter the great empire, the last being coeval with the

made its voyage this year 1683 to the not small luster of the Catholic
religion.</i></p>

<p> ... 908. The third volume has already related that a mission left
Espa&ntilde;a in the year 1660 in charge of father Fray Eugenio de los
Santos.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1700src" href="#xd0e1700">47</a> He
brought in that mission, however, only eighteen choir religious and two
lay brothers whose names I have been unable to ascertain, as the
instruments with which I would have to do so have not come to me from
Espa&ntilde;a. They all reached Mexico in the above-mentioned year and
since because of various accidents that happened during the voyage, in
the islands and in the port of Cavite no ships came from Philipinas to
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, either that year or the two following, the mission
had to stay in the said city all that time incurring the expenses and
fatal consequences that one can understand. In the year 1662 the
viceroy of Mexico despatched a boat to the islands to get a report of
their condition, for there was fear that they had been invaded by
enemies. One of those missionaries ventured in that boat, and arriving
at Manila it caused not a little rejoicing to the inhabitants there.
The next year ships from Philipinas were seen in the port of Acapulco,
and as a consequence fourteen religious took passage in them and
arrived at Manila in August 1663, and not in 1684 as was wrongly
reported in volume three. The five others remained in Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, but they afterwards reached their destination and all
served in those fields of Christendom where they were of great use.</p>

<p>909. Father Fray Christoval de Santa Monica, <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199">199</a>]</span>after having been
provincial of Philipinas, to which dignity he was elected in the year
1656, was appointed in 63, to come to Espa&ntilde;a in order to collect
and lead a mission. He came then, having received on the way not a few
favors from St. Nicholas of Tolentino&mdash;favors which he received
under the appreciable quality of miracles, but which we cannot specify
for lack of documents. He negotiated in Madrid as successfully as could
be desired, and collected a mission of twenty-four religious, all
generally of good qualities and with the characteristics that are
desired in that province. He set sail with that valiant squadron June
16, 1666. [After various miraculous happenings on the way, the vessel
reached Vera Cruz in safety, whence the passengers went across the
peninsula to Acapulco. August of 1667 the Recollects all reached Manila
save two who remained in Mexico for another year because of
sickness.]</p>

<p>910. In the year 1668, the venerable father Fray Juan de la Madre de
Dios, of Blancas, was elected president of Mexico in the provincial
chapter of Mexico, and father Fray Agustin de Santa Monica, commissary
for Espa&ntilde;a. The latter died aboard ship, and on that account,
when the former arrived at Mexico, he found an order within two years
to go to the court of Madrid in order to discuss some matters of not
small magnitude, and to give his vote for the province in the general
chapter. The authority and money for the conduction of a mission were
long delayed, but at last he received them both at the end of 1674,
whereupon he displayed so good zeal that he took passage with
twenty-six religious in June 1675. He reached Mexico with his gospel
militia, where he was ordered by the province to return to <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200">200</a>]</span>Espa&ntilde;a to
conduct certain matters that could only be entrusted to his person.
Thereupon, sending his accounts to Philipinas, the mission went to the
islands in the year 1676 in charge of another prelate, and father Fray
Juan bent his steps toward his new destiny.</p>

<p>911. Another father, Fray Juan de la Madre de Dios, a native of
Cuenca, had gone to Philipinas in the mission of father Fray Christoval
de Santa Monica; in the year 1680, that definitory appointed him
commissioner to Espa&ntilde;a. He sailed the same year from the port of
Cavite in the galleon named &ldquo;San Telmo.&rdquo; [After a voyage
tempered with the mercy obtained by St. Nicholas of Tolentino, in
several dangerous situations, the father arrived at Acapulco, January
22, 1681, and was detained some time in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a by the
fever. Reaching Spain in November of the same year, he hastened to lay
his supplications at the royal feet, and was given a decree calling for
a mission of forty religious fathers and five lay brothers. &ldquo;He
also obtained a royal decree dated April 16 of the abovesaid year
[1682] in which his Majesty continued the annual alms of one hundred
and fifty pesos for the medicines which are used in our infirmary of
Man&igrave;la; and another of the thirtieth of the same month, in which
he also continued the alms of two hundred and fifty pesos and a like
number of fanegas of rice per year for the maintenance of the four
religious of Ours who were in charge of the Indians in
Man&igrave;la.&rdquo;]</p>

<p>914. In view of this, the edict for the mission was published by our
father vicar-general. An excellent mission was collected at Sevilla for
the purpose of taking passage in the fleet which was about to sail to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201">201</a>]</span>Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a in charge of General Don Diego de Sald&igrave;var.
Thereupon the mission sailed from Cadiz on the fourth of March, 1683,
and consisted of the following religious.</p>

<p>1. The father commissary, Fray Juan de la Madre de Dios, native of
Cuenca.</p>

<p>915. All the above, minus the one named at number 22 who died at
sea, and those included under numbers 9, 12, and 14, who hid in Puerto
Rico, in order that they might return to their provinces, as they did
do, arrived with the great good-will of the fleet, at Vera Cruz, June
1, 1683, whence they went to Mexico with all possible haste. There they
comported themselves with the greatest rigor, observance, abstraction,
and example, so that the hospitium appeared a desert. Thus they
succeeded in obtaining the favor of the viceroy, the count of
Par&egrave;des,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1815src" href=
"#xd0e1815">48</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href=
"#pb204">204</a>]</span>and the venerable archbishop Don Francisco de
Aguiar y Seyjas, who visited the fathers in the hospitium, and that not
only once. During that winter those who had not completed their
studies, continued them, and in that the father lector, Fray Juan de la
Concepcion and others who were not lectors, but were worthy to be,
worked with especial zeal. By the fifth of March, 1685, they began to
go out in bands to Acapulco, whence they set sail April 4, in the
almiranta, called &ldquo;San Telmo.&rdquo; They anchored in the port of
Sorsog&ograve;n, in Philipinas, on the fourteenth of July, and arrived
in Manila some time in August. There they were given a fine welcome and
were allowed some time to rest after so long a voyage. But they
afterward began another greater work in that vineyard with the
fulfilment which was hoped of not resting until they obtained their
reward in glory.</p>

<p>[Chapter iv, treating of the general chapter of 1684, notes (p. 457)
that the first definitor chosen for Philipinas was father Fray
Francisco de San Nicol&agrave;s, and the second definitor, Fray
Migu&egrave;l de Santa Monica; as first and second discreets (p. 458),
were chosen father Fray Bl&agrave;s de la Concepcion and father Fray
Nicol&agrave;s de Tolentino.]</p>

<p>[Most of chapter v is taken up with the life of father Fray Juan de
la Madre de Dios, called also Blancas. He was born in the town of
Blancas, Aragon, of honorable parentage, his family name being Garcias.
From his early years of a religious turn of mind, he at length attained
the height of his desires by professing (June 15, 1635) in the convent
of Borja. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href=
"#pb205">205</a>]</span>In 1650, after having preached very acceptably
at the convent of Zaragoza, he enlisted in the Philippine mission
organized by father Fray Jacinto de San Fulgencio. On his arrival at
Manila he preached at the convent in that city and engaged in other
work (being also the confessor of the governor Sabiniano Manrique de
Lara) until December, 1655. At that time his health giving out because
of an accident, he went with the then father provincial, father Fray
Francisco de San Joseph, to the convent at Bolinao in the Zambal
district, leaving behind with the governor a folio MS. book which he
had written during the preceding two years entitled <i lang="es">
Governador Christiano, entre Neophitos</i> (Christian governor among
neophytes), for spiritual guidance in all sorts of matters. In Bolinao,
the change of climate and work restored the father&rsquo;s health in a
short time, but he remained in that place until the new provincial
chapter in Manila. At that chapter he was chosen prior of the Manila
convent against his wishes. Again in 1658 ill health compelled him to
go to Bolinao, where he remained this time four years. His efforts to
keep the natives there quiet during the times of the insurrections were
of great fruit. He labored zealously in that district even visiting the
schools in addition to the regular duties of a missionary. He received
a number of devout women into the tertiary branch of the order. He was
untiring in his efforts for both the spiritual and corporal good of his
charges.]</p>

<p><i>Father Fray Juan de la Madre de Dios founds a village of Indians,
converted by dint of his zeal. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206"
href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>is elected definitor and retires from the
commerce of men to adorn himself with the perfection of his
virtues.</i></p>

<p> ... 984. In a site called Cacagu&agrave;yanan which means
&ldquo;the place of many bamboos,&rdquo; six leguas or so from
Bolin&agrave;o there were for years back a not small number of Indians,
who had fled from the surrounding villages, and who are there called
Zimarr&ograve;nes. They having abandoned in its entirety the faith
which they had received at baptism, and accompanied by many heathen,
not only rendered vain the attempts of mildness and of force which had
several times been practiced to reduce them to a Christian and
civilized life, but either by declared war, or by means of skilful
cunning, did not cease to cause constant depredations in the Catholic
villages which were subject to Spanish dominion. So true is the
statement contained in various parts of this history, that our
ministers of Philipinas, although they dwell in mission fields already
formed, go forth to living war against infidelity, and although the
Christianity of Zamb&agrave;les was the first one converted by our
discalced order, even there our religious have no lack of meritorious
occupation. From the first time that our venerable father was in
Bolin&agrave;o, he worked with his accustomed zeal in order to place
those people in the pathway of their eternal salvation. He had obtained
from them that the Christians should be obedient to the law, and that
the heathen should leave the opaque shades of paganism, so that it was
conceded to him to found a new settlement in the island of P&ograve;ro
with them, with a general pardon and the accustomed privileges. Moved
by so good hopes the father went to chapter, and <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207">207</a>]</span>since he had so much
influence with the governor of the islands to whom the giving of such
licenses pertains, he procured one for the founding of the village
which he was attempting, with all the privileges that those
Zimarr&ograve;nes and idolaters could desire. But since the religious
to whom it was charged, did not succeed in finding the means prescribed
by prudence to unite spirits dissimilar in other regards, not only was
the project not obtained, but their good-wills having been irritated,
the desired attainment came to appear impossible.</p>

<p>985. So passed affairs, when renouncing the priorate of
Man&igrave;la, as we have said above, that gleaming sun returned to
illumine the hemisphere of Bolin&agrave;o, and not being able to
prevent the activity of his light, he immediately shed his reflected
light even to the darkest caves where those Indians were taking refuge
in the manner of wild beasts, fleeing from their own good and blindly
enamored of the most unhappy freedom. Again did the father establish
the compacts for their conversion. In the first step that he took in
the undertaking, he made the greatest sacrifice of himself, by exposing
his life to a danger which might make the most courageous man tremble,
if he were less holy. For when he heard that the fugitive Christians
and a great number of heathens and some Chinese idolaters were
celebrating a solemn feast to the demons, in the above-mentioned place
of Cacaguay&agrave;nan, he determined to go thither in person with the
intrepidity suitable to his valor, and almost alone to oppose so
sacrilegious worship and at the same time reduce those who paid that
worship. In these ceremonies called <i>Maganitos</i> in the language of
the country, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href=
"#pb208">208</a>]</span>intoxication is the most essential part of the
solemnity. And since the Zambal Indians are extremely warlike,
esteeming it the principal part of their nobility, unless they are
illumined with the Catholic faith, to lessen with inhuman murders the
species of which they consider themselves as individuals, adding to
this that they consider it as an attention paid to their religion, to
take away the life of any Christian who approaches their district,
where they pay such adorations to their deities, then one can
conjecture the great risk that beset that soldier of Jesus, when he
attacked such an army of infernal furies, in order to withdraw them
from a darkness so dense into the refulgent light of the Catholic
religion.</p>

<p>986. But its good outcome deprived the action of the censure of
temerity, which showed that it was governed by a special motion of the
Holy Spirit, whose impulse at times trespassing the lines of what the
world calls prudence, causes one to undertake projects which our finite
reason qualifies as rashness. The fact is that when the venerable
father arrived at the dense part of a solitary thicket in whose
melancholy shades those Indians had gathered to worship as a god one
who is not a god, he met them with the qualities of meek sheep, when he
might have feared to find them like ferocious wolves, who would
consider it a sport of their cruelty to rend him to pieces. Beyond any
doubt the hand of God, who wished to preserve the life of one who
despised it for His sake, was in this; for since the infernal fury with
which the heathen clothe themselves on such occasions is assured, one
cannot attribute their gentleness on this occasion to natural causes.
That most zealous minister put his hand, then, to the double-edged
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>sword
of the preaching, and fighting with it according to his wont so
skilfully, made himself master almost without any resistance of those
hearts which were filled with apostasy and infidelity, setting up in
them the banner of our holy Catholic faith. The complete attainment of
so famous a victory was retarded somewhat, because of the outbreak of
the insurrection of Pangasin&agrave;n. In him was verified what
experience has always demonstrated, namely, that a very quiet
disposition is needed so that the divine word may be born in souls by
the faith. But at last when all the heads of that monstrous hydra were
cut off, the blessed father had the happiness to obtain the fruit of
his zeal by constructing a new village in the site called
Mang&agrave;sin. That was the most suitable place in the island of
P&ograve;ro, and was called by another name Cabarr&ograve;yan. From the
beginning he counted eighty houses in it and a like number of families,
all drawn from the captivity of the devil to the perfect liberty of the
kingdom of Christ.</p>

<p>[The father preached many sermons to the Zambals in their own
language, which he had begun to learn when he first went to
Bolin&agrave;o, so many in fact that they formed two MS. volumes in
quarto; and of them copies were made for the use of those not so well
versed as himself in the Zambal tongue. In April 1662 he was chosen
definitor at the provincial chapter, and lived for the three years of
that office in the Manila convent. At the following chapter in 1665,
father Fray Juan was elected provincial against his will. His term was
one that needed his strong rule, for there were troubles with the
governor, Diego Salcedo, who offered obstacles to the smooth ordering
of affairs. He materially advanced <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210"
href="#pb210">210</a>]</span>his order and brought some new stability
into the body which had suffered in the recent earthquakes, and the
Chinese and native insurrections. At the completion of his triennium he
was chosen president of the Recollect hospitium in Mexico. Setting sail
for his destination, July 4, 1668, the port of Acapulco was reached
only on the twenty-second of the following January, after a voyage
replete with storm and sickness. Proceeding to his destination the
father entered the hospitium of Mexico on the twelfth of February of
the same year. In 1671, as related above, Father Juan de la Madre de
Dios was ordered to cast the vote of his province in the general
chapter held in Spain in 1672, and also to attend to various matters
for his order. There his stay being somewhat prolonged because of lack
of funds and other things he was made visitor general of certain
Spanish convents, and was later elected to high officers of the order
in Aragon. Returning to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a with a band of missionaries
he was again sent to Spain on business of the order, but a broken arm
received while on his way from Sevilla to Madrid, caused his retirement
to the Zaragoza convent, where he died January 10, 1685, at the age of
68. Throughout his life, he was most humble and led an austere
existence.]</p>

<p>[Section ii of the following chapter treats of the life of father
Fray Thom&agrave;s de San Geronimo. This father was born at the village
of Yebenes, in the archbishopric of Toledo, his family name being
Ay&agrave;la. He took the habit in the Madrid convent, July 28, 1646.
Upon going to the Philippines he was sent to the missions of the
Visayas. Devoting himself there to the study of the languages he
learned several of the Visayan tongues, especially the Cebuan, <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211">211</a>]</span>&ldquo;the
principal Visayan tongue.&rdquo; In that language he translated the
catechism, which was printed at Manila in 1730; compiled an explanation
of the Christian Doctrine, which was printed in 1730; and composed a
vocabulary in the Cebuan tongue, and another in the dialects spoken in
Cagay&agrave;n and Tagal&ograve;an. In addition he left two volumes of
sermons in the vernacular of the country. He served as prior for six
years in the convent of Billig, Mindanao; six years in Cagay&agrave;n,
and various times at the island of Romblon, and finally in Siargao. In
1680 he was elected provincial, and served his term so faithfully and
well, visiting and working assiduously, that he was re&euml;lected in
1686 against his will. But he was destined not to fill that office
again for death took him May 19, 1686. After his first term he served
in the island of Rombl&ograve;n. He was a most zealous missionary. The
remainder of the chapter and chapter vii following do not deal with
Philippine affairs.]</p>

<p><i>Our province of Philipinas takes charge of the spiritual
administration of three islands, namely, Masb&agrave;te, Tic&agrave;o,
and Bur&igrave;as, with no little luster to the Catholic
religion.</i></p>

<p> ... 1108. In the great archipelago of San Lazaro, as one enters the
Philipinas from Marianas, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href= 
"#pb212">212</a>]</span>the islands of Luz&ograve;n, Mind&ograve;ro,
Pan&agrave;i, Zeb&ugrave;, and L&egrave;yte form among themselves an
almost perfect circle which has a circumference along the beaches from
the center of about two hundred leguas encircling the above-named
islands, which are very near one another. Within this circumference,
toward the part of Mind&ograve;ro and Panay, are located the islands of
Rombl&ograve;n, and toward the part of L&egrave;yte those of
Masb&agrave;te, Tic&agrave;o and Bur&igrave;as, which belong to the
bishopric of Nueva C&agrave;ceres in ecclesiastical matters, and to the
alcaldeship of Albay in political matters. Masb&agrave;te, which is the
chief island, is sixty leguas southwest of Man&igrave;la. It lies in a
latitude of about sixty degrees, has a circumference of fifty leguas, a
length of nineteen, and a breadth of five or six.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1891src" href="#xd0e1891">49</a> The island of Tic&agrave;o is
about nine leguas long, four and one-half wide, and about twenty-three
leguas in circumference.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1897src" href= 
"#xd0e1897">50</a> That of Bur&igrave;as has a circumference of
twenty-six leguas, four wide and twelve long.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1903src" href="#xd0e1903">51</a> Masb&agrave;te has the reputation
of having the richest gold mines that were found by the first
Spaniards, and from which they benefited to a great extent. Their
working has not been continued, either for lack of people suitable
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>for
this work or for other reasons which do not concern us. That of
Buri&agrave;s abounds in the palm called Buri, of whose fruit and even
of whose trunk, the Indians make an extraordinary bread. That of
Tic&agrave;o produces many woods, excellent for the construction of
medium-sized boats. The natives of those three islands are of the same
qualities as the rest of the Philipinas. However, they have become very
sociable because of the almost continuous intercourse that they have
with the Spaniards, on account of the many who pass on their way to
other countries.</p>

<p>1109. Those islands were reduced to the crown of Espa&ntilde;a in
1569 by Don Luis Henriquez de Guzman, a knight of Sevilla, whose
conquest made them thoroughly subject in everything to Captain
Andr&egrave;s de Ibarra. Thereupon, scarcely had the way been opened by
arms, when the venerable father, Fray Alonso Ximenez, an Observant of
our order, entered Masb&agrave;te to preach the law of grace. He, as is
asserted by father Fray Gasp&agrave;r de San Agustin, may be called the
apostle of that island, in consideration of the great amount of his
labors therein for the extension of the Catholic faith. Other apostolic
workers of the same institute followed his tracks later, and they went
to Tic&agrave;o and Bur&igrave;as. Consequently, in the year 1605, the
province of Santo Nombre de Jesus founded a mission composed of the
above three islands. The first prior appointed was father Fray
Francisco Guerrero, instructor of Christian doctrine, who was of
well-known zeal. But our calced fathers kept the care of their
administration only until the year 1609, when the intermediary chapter
resigned that district and its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214"
href="#pb214">214</a>]</span>villages into the hands of the bishop of
Nueva C&agrave;ceres, Don Pedro de Arce, in order that he might appoint
secular clergy as he wished, who could attend to the Christian Indians
with the bread of the doctrine.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1915src"
href="#xd0e1915">52</a> From that time until the year 1688, various
curas had successive charge of the administration of those souls in
order to teach them the road of glory. But notwithstanding that that
district had only two hundred and fifty families when they took charge
of it (as the above-cited Father Gaspar confesses) whose number
continued to decline afterward because of the Moro invasions, one cura
could in no way be maintained, and scarce could one be found to take
charge of that church.</p>

<p>1110. Things were in this condition, then, when the most illustrious
master, Don Fray Andr&egrave;s Gonzales, who deservedly ascended to the
bishopric of Nueva C&agrave;ceres from the ranks of the Order of
Preachers, represented to the king on May 28, 1682 that in order that
the villages of his diocese might be rightly administered spiritually,
it would be indispensable to assign its curacies in another manner and
give some of them into the charge of religious. In consideration of
that he petitioned his Majesty to commit the approbation of the new
plan considered to his governor of those islands, so that as
vice-patron, he might proceed in it. The king conceded what that
prelate asked by his decree dated Madrid, August 13, 1685, and his
Excellency presented the new formation of districts to the governor
with all its changes. By it he applied to our province all the mission
of Masb&agrave;te, and its adjacent islands, as well <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215">215</a>]</span>as the villages
of Ing&ograve;zo, Catanavan, Vigo, and the rancherias contiguous, all
located in the island of Luz&ograve;n, which hitherto had belonged to
the curacy of P&igrave;riz, so that another new mission might be formed
under charge of our discalced order. The governor was the admiral of
galleons, Don Gabriel de Cruceleygui, knight of the habit of Santiago.
By an act of November 26, 1686, he approved <i lang="la">in toto</i>
the idea of the bishop, and, as a consequence, the assignation made to
us of the above-mentioned villages, so that we might administer them as
curas. However, because of several troubles that resulted, our province
accepted only the mission of Masb&agrave;te, and renounced the right
that they might have had to the other villages of the island of
Luz&ograve;n, for they could be administered by the fathers of St.
Francis with less trouble.</p>

<p>1111. The constant reasons for the acts by which the bishop assigned
to us the above-mentioned district were reduced to the fact that there
was but one secular priest in it, and he was insufficient for its
administration. For it was proved that only four persons had died with
the sacraments within the long space of four years, while those who had
passed to the other life without that benediction numbered one hundred
and eighteen. Add to this that the baptism of small children had been
delayed many months as the parish priest did not go but very seldom to
visit the distant villages. This ought not to induce inferences against
the well-proved zeal of those venerable priests, that they had
neglected their duties in attending to the obligations of the ministry.
For since there was but one ecclesiastic in all three islands, and
those islands occupy so great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216"
href="#pb216">216</a>]</span>an extent, and the villages are so distant
from one another, how could he attend to so many parishioners with the
pastoral food? It is a fact that even after our religious had entered
there and three or four were kept busy continually, scarce could they
fully attend to all their duties as spiritual directors, without some
inculpable lack being evident; and that notwithstanding that each one
labored as many, for not few of them have lost their health because of
the work, as we shall see hereafter. Consequently, one ought not to be
surprised if those Indians were poorly administered before, for it is
undeniable that one person cannot attend to so many laborious cares, as
can many, although he may equal them in zeal.</p>

<p>1112. The bishop and governor convinced, then, in this matter,
despatched the fitting provisions in November 1686 in order that our
reformed branch might take charge of those souls. This plan was of
great moment to the province, for the said islands, besides being the
necessary passage way and very suitable station for those who voyage
from Man&igrave;la to Carhaga and Zeb&ugrave;, are the stopping place
of the ships which sail from Cav&igrave;te to Acapulco and return from
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a to Philipinas. It is very common for the ships to
stop in their ports to get fresh supplies, and await suitable winds. On
that account there originated the greatest convenience in possessing
them in our custody, because of what makes for the spiritual: for the
provincials, when they sail out upon their visits; for the
commissioners when they come to Espa&ntilde;a for missions; for the
missions themselves when they arrive at the islands; and for the
multitude of our religious who journey from one part to another,
employed in the holy commerce of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217"
href="#pb217">217</a>]</span>souls. Without doubt those reasons
somewhat aided the zeal with which our tireless workers in those
countries have always procured the good teaching of the faithful, and
the conversion of the faithless, at the cost of their own very great
fatigue and of great penalties. On that account it was determined in
the intermediary chapter of 1687 to accept the charge of that
reasonable territory to whose labor God called them by the mouth of the
bishop. And more when it was learned that, although the number of the
Christians was greatly diminished, the interiors of the islands of
Masb&agrave;te and Bur&igrave;as were densely inhabited with
innumerable Indians, apostates from the faith and assembled there not
only from their villages, but also from other parts, in whose reduction
a great service would be done to God and the king, and with this fruit
the sweatings of the spiritual administration would be eased, which by
themselves alone gave much to grieve over.</p>

<p>1113. Finally matters having been arranged, fathers Fray Juan de San
Phelipe, the outgoing provincial, and Fray Juan de la Encarnacion, with
another associate, of whose name we are ignorant, left Manila in May
1678 [<i>i.e.</i>, 1688] to take charge of the above-mentioned
district. They went to the village of Tic&agrave;o, where they met the
cura, then Bachelor Don Christoval Carvallo, who had been notified by
the suitable acts in the month of August. The latter agreed without the
least repugnance to surrender the churches and his administration. He
did it gracefully on September 2 of the same year in the village of
Mobo, a site in the island of Masb&agrave;te, which was, and is, the
chief village of all the others, and that mission remained from that
time on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href=
"#pb218">218</a>]</span>subject to our discalced order. The Indians
received the religious with signs of the greatest rejoicing. It is a
fact that they knew our holy habit some years before, because some of
our gospel missionaries had stopped in their port on account of storms,
when they were passing by Masb&agrave;te on their way to their
destinations, and had attended to instructing them and even
administering them the sacraments. From that came the almost general
joy with which the discalced Augustinians were received there; and from
that reception originated the great fruit which they obtained with
their preaching. The fathers endeavored to have the love shown them by
the Indians increase, not being unaware that the good-will of the
hearers is a very plausible disposition so that the work of the
preachers may be useful. Knowing also that the good opinion of the
evangelical minister gives great force to his words, in order that
theirs might be increased they aimed to confirm them with works. They
bore themselves as saints in private and public in order to give a good
example in all things. With that method, one can believe the great
number of Christians that were gathered to Catholicism in the said
islands, as we shall relate later.</p>

<p>1114. But since it was necessary for this attainment to found some
convent, they erected it that same year in the village of Mobo, which
had the most inhabitants. It has Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Remedios
[<i>i.e.</i>, our Lady of Remedies] as titular, and a very costly
church is being built which abounds in reredoses and other adornments
with a sacristy provided with vestments [? <i lang="es">jocalias</i>]
and ornaments. The house is very capacious and has <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219">219</a>]</span>all the necessary
rooms and has moreover cells for the religious who generally live in
it. That convent was the refuge of the gospel ministers who lived in it
in suitable number to look after the Christians in spiritual matters
and to allure the apostates to the bosom of the Christian religion
which they had abandoned. Thence, as swift moving clouds, they went out
to fertilize the other villages with the water of their doctrine and
having become hunters of souls, to overrun the deserts and mountains.
Although there were not more than six villages in the three islands
when our discalced religious entered to administer them, in a few years
they established three more where they could shelter those who were
being reduced to our holy faith. And hence the workers of that mission
with inexplicable toil cared for a great number of souls who dwelt in
the capital of Mobo, and in its annexed villages or visitas of
Tic&agrave;o, Bur&igrave;as, Balino, Pal&agrave;nog, Habuyo&agrave;n,
Tagmas&ugrave;so, Burac&agrave;n, and Limbojan. In that extensive
territory not few times did God explain His mercies with repeated
miracles in confirmation of the faith which Ours were preaching. Some
received with baptism the health of the body, and others found
themselves freed from their pains by the prayers of the ministers,
accompanied by the laying on of hands. However, inasmuch as the
manuscripts give us these notices without specification, we cannot name
the individual miracles.</p>

<p>1115. A very lamentable event for the islands which happened in the
year 1726, was the reason for the founding of another convent in
Tic&agrave;o. It happened as follows. The galleon &ldquo;Santo Christo
de Burgos,&rdquo; while making its voyage to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>anchored at
the port of Tic&agrave;o in order to await good weather before taking
to the open sea. But it was shipwrecked there by a storm which came
upon it. On board that vessel was Don Julian de Velasco, a minister
assigned to the Audiencia of Mexico. He managed to obtain his spiritual
improvement from that disaster so transcendental to all classes of
Philipinas by the practice of good works. He did not care to return to
Man&igrave;la, although he could have done so, but remained with all
his family in the said port until he could get passage the next year.
Among what he was able to save of his lost possessions, he placed his
first attention in seeing that the holy image of the holy Christ of
Burgos which was on the ship as its titular, should not be lost; for it
was his intention to place it at his own expense in some church, so
that it might have public veneration for the benefit of souls.
Scarcely, then, did he have that celestial treasure in his hands, when
he exposed it to worship on the high altar of the church of
Tic&agrave;o with ornaments suitable to his devout affection.
Thereafter followed the assignment of some income so that there might
be a resident evangelical minister there, both so that a chaplain might
not at least be wanting to the holy image, and so that the Indians
might not lack more continual teaching. For that reason, the province
afterward determined to found a convent in Tic&agrave;o. To it were
assigned the villages situated in the islands of Tic&agrave;o and
Bur&igrave;as, and to the convent of Mobo those of the island of
Masbate. The ministers were thus able to obtain more relief because
their number had increased, although they still had much to do in order
to attend to everything. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href=

<div class="div4">
<h5 class="normal">&sect; II</h5>

<p><i>Relation of the progress made by Catholicism in those islands by
the preaching of our laborers; and the great hardships that they
suffered for that end.</i></p>

<p>1116. In the year 1724, the province of Philipinas begged the king
to confirm, by special decree, the possession that had been given them
in his royal name of the islands of Masb&agrave;te. His Majesty ordered
the governor of Philipinas and the bishop of Nueva C&aacute;ceres, on
the eleventh of February, 1725, to make no innovation in regard to the
spiritual administration of the said district until he should provide
what was needful in his royal Council. He ordered them also to inform
him of the progress that had been made by the faith in that territory
since it had been in our charge. On that account some juridical
investigations were made in Man&igrave;la in order to inform the king
with acts. By them it appeared that, although there had been only one
single parish priest in all the district of Masb&agrave;te before,
since it had been placed in charge of the Recollect fathers, three
religious at least had always lived there; and that, as was proved by
the books of the royal treasury, in the year 1687, anterior to our
possession, there were only one hundred and eighty-seven families in
the whole mission, while in the year 1722, there were five hundred and
eighty-five: so that in the space of thirty-four years they had
increased by three hundred and ninety-eight. For that reason the
governor, Marqu&egrave;s de Torrecampo, gave his king June 30, 1727, a
very favorable report of our discalced order in the terms of this
honorable clause. &ldquo;The district <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb222" href="#pb222">222</a>]</span>of Masb&agrave;te, in charge of
the discalced Augustinians, has had an increase of 398 whole tributes
through the apostolic zeal of those ministers. They, not only in that
district, but also in the rest of these islands, dedicate themselves to
the propagation of our holy Catholic faith with the greatest toil and
with the most visible fruit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>1117. These increases will be of greater moment if we consider that,
if the families be reduced to the number of four persons each, as is
customary there, the said district consisted, at the time it was given
to us, of 748 souls, and in thirty-eight years it had increased to
2,340, the increase amounting to 1,592 persons. But sixteen years later
(namely, the year 1738, when father Fray Juan Francisco de San Antonio
printed the first volume of the history of his seraphic province of
Philipinas), those increases were almost doubled.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e1971src" href="#xd0e1971">53</a> Then directing his pen to the end
that leads to truth, he assures us that there are new villages in the
island of Masb&agrave;te with three thousand three hundred and
forty-five souls; in that of Tic&agrave;o, two, with four hundred and
seventy-five persons; and one in that of Bur&igrave;as, with one
hundred and eighty. Whence it is inferred that three more villages were
newly established: namely, in Masb&agrave;te, those of Navangui and
Baraga; and in Tic&agrave;o, that of San Jacinto, at the port so named,
where the ships now stop for fresh supplies, before taking to the open
sea. Also the number of souls has increased to one thousand six hundred
and sixty by the impulses of the preaching of our reformed branch,
aided efficaciously by divine grace. All the increase of this district
since it has been in our charge has <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb223" href="#pb223">223</a>]</span>been six newly-created villages,
and three thousand two hundred and fifty-two souls brought to the
Catholic bosom. And we even ought to infer that many more have been
converted, for by the invasions of the Moros, which are told at length
in the third volume,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1976src" href=
"#xd0e1976">54</a> the number of the Christians could not but be
lessened.</p>

<p>1118. It only remains now to ascertain whence proceeded those
Indians who so increased the above-mentioned villages. It was stated in
another place in the third volume<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1981src"
href="#xd0e1981">55</a> that there was a great number of mountain
Indians in the islands of Masb&agrave;te and Bur&igrave;as, who are
there called Zimarrones. They were feared, for they lived without God,
or king, and were given up to the liberties of paganism. Those were
certain men, if they can be called so, who having apostatized the
faith, had taken to the deserts and high places, where they defended
their native barbarity at every step, against those who were trying to
reduce them and to procure their own good. They had gathered there,
either they or their ancestors, from the villages of the same islands,
as well as from Zeb&ugrave;, Leyte, and others, to escape the
punishment due them for their crimes. Consequently, they were people
especially fierce. Among them were found to be many heathens, as they
had been born in those places where the sound of the preaching did not
penetrate. The others were still worse, as they had abandoned
Christianity. They did notable damage to the villages, and they even
robbed the boats that were anchored in the ports or bays, treacherously
taking many lives. The matter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224"
href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>had assumed such proportions that one
could not cross those islands by their interiors; and to approach their
shores was the same thing as putting in at an enemy&rsquo;s port. But
at present all the Zimarrones are reduced to the faith, and to the
obedience of the king without any exception. Hence one can travel
through the islands without the slightest risk, and boats can go
thither even to the uninhabited places. From that and from no other
beginnings have come the increase of that church, and there is not
small praise to our reformed branch from it.</p>

<p>1119. That progress of the faith was preceded by many hardships that
were suffered by the religious, some of which I shall state, noting
that innumerable others are omitted, in order not to bore our readers
by their relation, and because they resemble those that we shall
relate. It has already been stated, then, that for the space of more
than thirty years there was but one convent in the three islands, which
was established in the village of Mobo, whence the gospel laborers went
out to administer all the settlements of the district. For that
purpose, it was absolutely necessary for them to sail many leguas by
boisterous seas, or to travel by land in some parts by rough mountains,
threatened in the one place with shipwreck and in the other by
continual dangers. Since the new convent was established in the island
of Tic&agrave;o, the administration is more tolerable, although it is
always accompanied by indescribable fatigues. For the religious of Mobo
have to sail completely about the island of Masb&agrave;te in order to
fulfil their obligations, or if they prefer to journey by land, as they
are able, to one or two villages, they have to do it afoot with the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href=
"#pb225">225</a>]</span>greatest discomfort, through inaccessible
mountains, and exposed to dangers wellnigh insupportable. The
missionaries of Tic&agrave;o, besides having to coast a great part of
that island have to go many times during each year to that of
Bur&igrave;as, crossing the very stout currents of the sea from the
rapidity of which some of the missionaries have found themselves in the
utmost consternation. On the other hand, all the time that the Indians
remained Zimarrones, they allowed no passage to the zealous laborers
without them risking their lives to innumerable dangers; and even after
they had been reduced, the Moros were a substitute for them on the
outside, and inside many sorcerers, who tried, some by violence, and
others by their diabolical arts, to drive thence, and even from the
world, the ministers of souls. And who can tell all that they suffered
from all these causes? It was so great that some religious, never more
alive than when they were dead, came to die in the campaign like good
soldiers.</p>

<p>1120. Father Fray Ildephonso de la Concepcion was one of those who
sweated most in that ministry, and one of those who entered to
cultivate it in its early beginnings. By the ardor of his zeal, by the
example of his life, and by his apostolic preaching, he reduced many
apostates to the Catholic faith. Some of them were gathered into the
villages already established, and others, up to the number of eighty
families, founded through his influence, another new village on the
opposite coast from Mobo. Going then, from one to another part of the
islands, the solicitous fisher of souls had the boat in which he
journeyed swamped twice, one-half legua from shore, while another time
his boat was driven by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href=
"#pb226">226</a>]</span>storms on some reefs and dashed to pieces;
dangers in which many of those who accompanied him were lost, while the
father escaped miraculously with his life after having endured a
thousand anxieties. The Zimarrones, infidels, and bad Christians, given
up to doing ill to whomever procured their total welfare, now as
declared enemies, and again as wily friends, placed him almost
continually in monstrous danger of exhaling his last breath. In order
that he might visit promptly the new village which he had erected, he
opened a road from Mobo to it through the interior of the island. He
crossed it many times on foot, it being necessary for him to traverse
very lofty mountains exposed to all the inclemencies of the weather. He
suffered indescribable things for the faith, with the great hardship
that his vast zeal occasioned him, and which those Indians caused him
with their obstinacy. Finally he fell grievously ill, his pains
originating from the penalties of the said road which he frequented
several times in the course of a single month, as well as from the heat
and showers which he endured when going through the mountains in search
of those rational wild beasts. He died through the apostolic zeal, in
the manner in which all gospel laborers ought to depart this life.</p>

<p>1121. Father Fray Benito de la Assumpcion, a religious who seemed
born for the labors and successes of the spiritual administration,
followed that laborer in the care of that vineyard. He believed that,
without passing the limits of prudence, it would be very seasonable for
the souls of his parishioners to reduce them to living closer together
in a fewer number of villages, and he thus tried to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227">227</a>]</span>bring it to pass.
Especially did he propose to himself the plan that the Indians shortly
before reduced to the new village which we have mentioned in the
preceding number, should move to the capital or chief village of Mobo,
for he formed the correct judgment that they would be better Christians
if they had at all hours the good example of their ministers before
their eyes. It is not so difficult to move a whole village in
Philipinas as it would be in Europa; for the Indians build their houses
without cost and easily. They also find in all parts lands suitable for
their cultivation without any expense from their pockets. Yet
notwithstanding that one cannot easily tell the vast labors, watches,
and afflictions that come upon the religious when they attempt such
reductions of the Indians. The latter desire with too great endeavor,
to have their residence where they cannot be registered, in order to
work with greater freedom, and excuse themselves if possible from all
human subjection, and even from divine law, without caring greatly for
their own spiritual interests, but each one going at will to his
rancheria or field where it is not easy for the father minister to
visit them or assist them with the holy sacraments during their
sicknesses. For that reason all hell is conjured against the teacher of
the doctrine, if he tries to place such reductions into effect, from
which many spiritual interests would follow. That venerable father
suffered so much with his undertaking that he caused universal wonder
that it did not cost him his life, and the worst thing was that he
could not see it accomplished.</p>

<p>1122. Not only in this, but also in other projects of known utility,
did he have much to endure and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228"
href="#pb228">228</a>]</span>much from which to gather merit. With the
zeal of Elias did he relentlessly persecute divine offenses, while he
at the same time loved the persons most especially. It was the same for
him to discover any trace of superstition or the slightest vestige of
the badly extinguished infidelity, and to fly to its destruction with
all his power. Amid continual risks of losing his life, he exercised
his gigantic charity for many years in directing the souls of those
islands to God, without any fear of death whose scythe he saw upon him
many times. The Moros with their stealthy attacks, the infidels or
apostates with open malice, and the evil Christians with their
subterfuges and deceits made him almost continually suffer for justice.
But he worked on manfully as one who had the refuge of his life in God,
and consoling his weakened heart with the divine grace he supported the
persecutions from which the Lord wove him a crown. In the above-named
village a chief Indian named Canam&agrave;n irritated by the attempted
reduction, and because the father checked him publicly for a certain
scandalous concubinage, raised his head in open mutiny. With many
followers he sought the father and persecuted him in order to deprive
him of life. At that revolution the venerable religious was sorely
grieved, and it was considered as a special prodigy that he could
escape from so sacrilegious hands. Finally, for the same reason another
Indian of the village of Tic&agrave;o (exasperated by the just
reprehension and punishment which that famous minister had applied to
him as an indispensable medicine for his faults) caused him to be the
holocaust of his burning zeal for the good of souls, by the hidden
method of poison, through the potency <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb229" href="#pb229">229</a>]</span>of which father Fray Benito lost
his life, in order to obtain a better one in glory.</p>

<p>1123. After the above fathers, father Fray Diego de San Gabriel
entered to take up the toil with the profit of increased fruit in the
cultivation of that field. He was the amazement of charity in regard to
God because of his care for self-perfection, and in regard to his
neighbor, because of the way in which he desired his salvation. In
order that he might attain that end he pardoned no toil, if it were
fitting for the spiritual welfare of the Indians. He showered favors
upon his parishioners by trying to take them to the kingdom of heaven.
And although for this the latter loved him more, some were not wanting
among so many who persecuted him, returning him evil for good. But like
another David when they troubled him with their injuries, the venerable
father clad himself in haircloth, humbled his soul in fasting, and
occupied himself in prayer. By that means he delighted himself in God,
taking pleasure in hardships as if they were the fountain of health. In
order to induce his parishioners to the devotion of the most holy Mary
he composed and published in the Visayan language a book of the
miracles of our Lady of Carmen; and the most sweet Virgin repaid his
good zeal by liberating him with circumstances that appeared miraculous
from several shipwrecks, and from other innumerable multitudes of
dangers. On the beach of the village of Balino a certain Indian gave
him a cruel wound with a dagger, because he checked some faults in him.
The father recognized as a favor of the Mother of Mercy, not only the
fact that he was not quite killed, as might have happened, but also the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>cure
of the wound, almost without medicine. But at last, as he was sailing
as secretary, which post he had obtained later, to visit those villages
and others of Visayas, a storm coming down upon him swamped the boat
and he was drowned, together with the father provincial, then our
father Fray Juan de San Andr&egrave;s.</p>

<p>1124. And now in order to conclude in a few words, a matter that we
can not even with many words consider adequately, we add that the
venerable fathers Fray Antonio de Santa Monica and Fray Thom&agrave;s
de San Lucas said many times without a trace of boasting that, although
they had been many times in the doctrinas and missions, in none of them
had they found so much to suffer as in that of Masb&agrave;te. Father
Fray Francisco de Santa Engarcia was twice in imminent danger of death;
first in shipwreck and later because an Indian tried to kill him, for
the reason that he had tried to get him to give up a certain
concubinage. But God having freed him from those dangers, allowed him
to perish in another through His occult judgments. It was a fact that
that father when attending to the fulfilment of his obligation gave
motive that certain of the Zimarron Indians whom he was endeavoring to
establish soundly in the Catholic faith gave him certain death-dealing
powders in his food, which although they did not deprive him of life
rendered him insensible and he became most pitiably insane. Many other
religious, whom we shall not mention for various reasons, suffered so
much while ministers of those islands, by shipwreck, bad weather, and
persecution, that if they did not obtain the crown to which they
aspired by death, they were left with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb231" href="#pb231">231</a>]</span>their health totally lost, and
lived amid continual aches and pains, until their last breath opened
for them, after some years, a pathway to heaven in order that they
might enjoy the reward of their well endured conflicts.</p>

of the first chapter. It treats of the transfer of the province of
Zambal to the Dominicans, and the occupation of the island of Mindoro
by the Recollects.]</p>

<p>2. Continuing with the events of this government, we must note that
Don Diego de Villaroto represented in the supreme Council of the Indias
that the island of Mindoro had a vast population who still retained the
dense darkness of their heathen blindness; and that if the spiritual
conquest of that island were given to some order, it would be easy to
illumine its inhabitants with the true light. That representation was
met by a royal decree, dated June 18, 1677, ordering the governor of
these islands, together with the archbishop, to entrust the reduction
of Mindoro to the order that should be most suitable and fitting for
that ministry; and that the curas employed in that island should be
appointed to chaplaincies <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href= 
"#pb232">232</a>]</span>or prebends. That royal decree was presented to
the royal Audiencia of Manila by Sargento-mayor Don Sebastian de
Villa-Real in October, 78. His Majesty&rsquo;s fiscal offered no
objection to its observance, and prompt obedience was rendered to it.
It was directed to his Excellency the archbishop, then Don Fray Phelipe
Pardo. That most illustrious gentleman, during the two times when he
was provincial of his order or province, urged as a thing greatly to be
desired and demanded by his brethren the Dominicans, that the
Augustinian Recollects yield them the province of Zambales, as it was
very fitting for communication with their province of Pangasinan, and
of the latter with Manila, and of those religious among themselves, who
could thus make their visits more comfortably, by always crossing
through their own ministries, thus avoiding the voyage through the
territory of others, which they regretted. Notwithstanding that those
matters were discussed with great courtesy (as is the case at present)
yet that was a demand that offended greatly the discalced Augustinians,
who regarded the Zambals as the true sons of their spirit, and the land
as watered with the blood and sweat of many of their members, and a
land which, being their firstborn, was most tenderly loved. The
Dominicans could never obtain their demand, although softened by
exchanges, for ministries were offered in which there was even more
than enough room for zeal.</p>

<p>3. By reason of the said royal despatch, his Excellency formed the
idea of completely removing the Recollects from Zambales and giving
them in exchange the island of Mindoro. He set about that <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>with great zest.
The Recollect provincial resisted, alleging that it was contrary to
their constitutions to abandon thus the province of Zambales. That
would mean treating it as their own possession. It would be better to
recognize it as a territory distributed by the universal patron; and,
admitting that it was impossible to surrender it without his royal
consent, individual laws communicate no right, especially when such
mission fields are <i lang="la">ad interim</i>. He also pleaded that
the Indians of Mindoro, both infidels and Christians, had as soon as
they heard that regular ministers were to be given them, urgently
requested Jesuits. On the contrary, the Zambals, when they were
notified that it was the intention to withdraw the Recollects from
their midst in order to introduce Dominicans, almost declared their
opinion in a terrible tumult. The Recollects preferred, therefore, that
such a change should not take place. But the archbishop was firm in his
resolution, and trampled all obstacles under foot. He united with the
governor, and both of them together forced the Recollect provincial,
Fray Joseph de San Nicolas, by threats, to agree to the change. The
governor pacified the Indians of Mindoro by means of his corregidor, so
that they should receive the Recollect fathers; and the Zambals by
means of the alcalde-mayor of Pangasinan, so that they should allow the
Dominicans to enter. Thereupon, the three seculars who had been in
charge of Mindoro were accommodated by suitable chaplaincies, and an
act was passed by the royal Audiencia, charging the Recollect fathers
with the administration of that island, with absolute clauses based on
the royal decree, without any provision or obligation to leave <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234">234</a>]</span>the
missions of Zambales for it. That decree was accepted when it was
announced, and was extended to the judicial cession of those missions,
when signed by the provincial of the Recollects, although protest was
made against it in the name of their province, by two influential
religious. On that account a second act was enacted in which those
missions were adjudged to the fathers of St. Dominic, for the
archbishop was very much in earnest in those arrangements.</p>

<p>4. Those decrees having been announced and accepted, the Dominicans
assumed possession of the cordillera of Zambales. That province had on
its coast eleven villages with actual missions, which were increased in
the neighboring mountains. The Recollects handed over that
administration without making any public disturbance, although all the
religious who had labored there protested vehemently, all of which
appeared in the judicial reports. The Augustinian Recollects went to
Mindoro with the fitting despatches for that corregidor ordering him to
deliver the administration [of that island] to them. Father Fray Diego
de la Madre de Dios, then definitor, was given charge of the district
of Baco, after it had been resigned by Bachelor Don Joseph de Rojas,
who held it; father Fray Diego de la Resurreccion of the curacy of
Calavite, in place of Licentiate Don Juan Pedraza, its parish priest;
while the curacy of Naohan was taken possession of by the father
definitor, Fray Eugenio de los Santos, who was exchanged for Bachelor
Don Martin Diaz. The whole transfer was completed before the end of the
year 79. Three other religious remained with the above three religious
as associates <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href=
"#pb235">235</a>]</span>and coadjutors, and those six ministers began
to scatter throughout the island. That island is in the center of this
vast archipelago, and was formerly called Mainit; but the Spaniards
gave it the name of Mindoro from a village called Minolo, located
between Puerto de Galeras and the bay of Ylog. It is triangular in
shape, its angles being three promontories: that of Calavite, facing
west; that of Dumah or Pola, facing north; and that of Burruncan,
facing south. In size it is the seventh of the more important islands,
and is about one hundred leguas in circumference. Its temperature is
naturally hot, but is tempered by the great dampness arising from
frequent rains. The height of its mountains aids also in that. On
account of such circumstances it is a very fertile land, and, although
not very healthful for strangers, good and favorable to its
inhabitants. The latter made themselves feared by their neighbors,
especially on the sea, where they attacked the most powerful, carrying
blood and fire everywhere. Notwithstanding, they were of great
simplicity, for when they saw the Europeans wearing clothes and
shoes&mdash;which they did not use&mdash;they imagined that that
adornment was natural to them. They are but little given to the
cultivation of the soil, and are content with wild fruits; sago, which
they get from the palm and which is a good food for them; the flesh of
wild animals; and fish, which the rivers and seacoast offer them in
great plenty. They have little rice, on account of their sloth in
sowing and tending it, for they make up that lack sufficiently in roots
and fruits. If they are weak, although corpulent, it is because of
their transcendent vice in being hostile to work. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236">236</a>]</span></p>

<p>5. Captain Juan de Salcedo made a beginning in the conquest of the
district of Mambur&agrave;o, in the year one thousand five hundred and
seventy. That conquest was completed from the point of Burruncan to
that of Calavite by the adelantado Miguel de Legaspi, in the beginning
of the following year. Gradually the remainder was subdued by the
missionaries, by whose treatment the rudeness of the manners of those
people was softened. Consequently, the encomienda of that large island
was very desirable. The Observant Augustinian fathers were employed in
its spiritual cultivation and founded the village of Baco. The
discalced fathers of St. Francis also labored there for some time, it
being ceded to them by the Observant Augustinians. They worked along
the Calavite side to Pola, which they abandoned either because those
natives were not at all disposed [to accept the faith], or because
those fathers had slight esteem for that island when compared with what
was offered them in Ylocos and Camarines. The Jesuits also labored
there, but always by the method of temporary missions, from time to
time, and had no stability. It only appears that they were more
continual in Naohan (which they founded), as long as it was preserved
by Father San Victores. When the latter went to the Marianas, the
Jesuits resigned that portion into the hands of the archbishop. It is
probable that the latter was Se&ntilde;or Poblete.<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e2055src" href="#xd0e2055">56</a> He immediately formed two
curacies for the secular clergy to look after those souls. Although
there were but few souls, the extent of their territory was so vast
that it was necessary to establish a third <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb237" href="#pb237">237</a>]</span>parish. Those seculars
maintained what was conquered, but that district did not yield a
sufficient recompense for the three ministers, and they were paid from
the royal treasury and from other pious funds. It was also even
difficult to find seculars who cared to take charge of such districts,
which were truly little to be desired. But obedience caused that there
never was a lack of seculars there, who maintained themselves until the
year 76, when the Recollects went there to take their places. As the
latter immediately placed six ministers there, they furthered the
conquest and reduction greatly in all parts. Hence, while they only
received about four thousand Christians, those were multiplied in a few
years and the number rose to eight thousand, and in 1716 they reached
the number of twelve thousand. There are still a great number of people
in the mountains, which are inhabited by wild men. Some of those men
are quite light-complexioned, and are believed to have originated from
the Chinese and Japanese established there for the convenience afforded
by the island, or who have put in there because of shipwreck, or been
driven thither by the winds. Others are Cimarron Negritos, who are the
first inhabitants, and, as it were, more native. Trustworthy persons
say that those people have a hard little tail in the proper place for
it, which prevents them from sitting down flat. If it is true (and I do
not doubt it, notwithstanding that it is disputed), it is not so
strange that I have no examples of it. Those prominences of the sacral
bone are considered as rare; but a beginning having been made in one,
it could have become natural in its propagation.</p>

<p>6. Thus did those Recollect religious find that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238">238</a>]</span>island, and,
believing it to be important for the reductions, they continued to
establish their regular administrations. The first was in Baco. There,
inasmuch as it was the capital, lived the corregidor, but the capital
was later moved to Calapan. In that district they formed the villages
of Calapan, Baco, Suban, Ylog, Minolo, and Camor&ograve;n, with a
number of annexed villages or visitas. The second was in Naohan, which
was extended into six annexed villages, namely, Pola, Pinamalayan,
Balete, Sumagui, Maliguo, and Bongabon. The third was in Calavite,
which formed the visitas of Dongon, Santa Cruz, Manbura&ograve;,
Tubili, and Santo Thomas. The fourth was in Mangarin, which was
extended into its dependencies, Guasic, Manaol, Bulalacao, and Ililin.
They also began an active mission in order to reduce the heathen
Mangyans, which had no other work than to employ itself in those
glorious reductions and conversions of grace. For one single man it was
an immense work, but the superior government gave no more stipends.
That mission was established on the bay of Ylog, and ministers and
infidels were pledged not to allow [there] any of the former
Christians, who might pervert the conversions. By that arrangement it
grew to a very large village, and there were practiced some of the old
customs that belonged to the primitive church. All that fine
flower-garden has been trampled down and even ruined by the Moros, as
will be related in due season.</p>

<p>7. The Dominican fathers also applied themselves to the work in the
province of Zambales. That province had already eleven villages formed,
although they were small, because that province has but few people. It
appeared to the new fathers that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239"
href="#pb239">239</a>]</span>that number of villages made their
administration difficult; consequently, they tried to reduce their
number by uniting some of them. That incorporation was difficult; hence
they increased the troops and arms of the presidio of Paynaven, the
center of that province. Through the protection afforded by those
troops, they broke up the whole province. The village of
Bolina&ograve;, which had a fair population, was located on an island,
which is separated from the land by only a channel, which forms its
famous and secure port.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2068src" href= 
"#xd0e2068">57</a> It was fertile and pleasant. They moved it to the
mainland, to a sandy shore, useless for anything, even for the ordinary
fields. Its lack of water they supplied with wells which they opened.
There they obtained some water, but it was thick, and in the time of
the dry season it entirely disappeared. The Indians who were harmed by
this measure were so angry at that moving, that many families retired
to Ylocos. In truth, that site is despicable. An eminence which looks
upon and almost dominates the port would have been much more suitable,
and they would have obtained better air there; while their boats, which
cannot navigate by the channel to the village during the blowing of the
north wind, so that the cargo has to be carried for a long distance on
the shoulders, would have obtained shelter. There are many other
inconveniences but one cannot think of a single advantage. They moved
the village of Agno<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2074src" href=
"#xd0e2074">58</a> from the coast into the interior, to <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240">240</a>]</span>a site which is a
swampy mudhole when there is the least rain. The village of Sigayan was
moved to another site, where the only advantage was a near-by river of
fresh water which was unnavigable. They left Masinloc<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e2082src" href="#xd0e2082">59</a> on its pleasant site, while
the village of Paynaven was moved inland to a site called Iba,<a class= 
"noteref" id="xd0e2088src" href="#xd0e2088">60</a> from which the new
village took its name, moving that village in order to get it away from
the commandant of the fort, whose proximity was annoying to them. They
did not regard it as a recompensable hardship for the minister of that
village to go on feast-days in order to say mass in the presidio, and
to repeat it afterwards in his own church. In order to increase that
place and give it the name of capital, they brought families from
Bolina&ograve;, who formed a large barangay. It has already been seen
that they made use of the fort in this, and that those who were moved
were not very well pleased. The Dominicans also founded, or better,
made from other villages, the village of Cabangaan<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e2094src" href="#xd0e2094">61</a> in an obscure site, which was
rough and surrounded by dense mountains, and suitable only for a hermit
and solitary life, but so far as others were concerned, a place of
profound melancholy. They also formed the village of Subic<a class= 
"noteref" id="xd0e2100src" href="#xd0e2100">62</a> from other villages,
which had only the advantages of its port to recommend it, while in
other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href=
"#pb241">241</a>]</span>respects it was most unpleasant. They also
filled the vacant places left by the many families who retired to the
mountains as a result of the violence exercised, with others whom they
brought from Pangasinan, a province abounding with people, who because
they are so numerous, and there is no room for all, leave their homes
more easily. In fact, they did that, too, in order to be surer of the
Zambals, in whose severe and warlike minds they did not have the
greatest confidence. Thus did they soften those people, or let us say
frankly, checked their vehemence. The reduction of the people of the
mountain, however much it is talked about, is not known, as neither is
the place where they could form villages or a village from them. Let us
leave then exaggerations, which, when they offend by comparison, cannot
fail to be odious. We shall treat of the restoration [of that province]
below, in its proper place.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2108src" href=

<div class="div3" id="xd0e2116">
<h4 class="normal">Chapter V</h4>

<p><i>The Augustinian Recollect fathers assume the spiritual government
of the islands of Masb&aacute;te, Ticao, and Burias. A geographical
description of those islands is presented.</i></p>

<p>1. Under the metaphor of husbandmen, the prophet Amos describes
those who are employed in the cultivation of souls. The chroniclers of
the Augustinian Recollect fathers describe those fathers for us as
zealous and laborious in their never-ceasing application in planting
and cultivating the word of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href= 
"#pb242">242</a>]</span>God in humble hearts. The Recollects assumed
charge, in addition to the fields already mentioned of the island of
Masbate with the neighboring islands of Ticao and Burias. Those islands
belong to the bishopric of Nueva Caceres in ecclesiastical matters, and
to the alcaldeship of Albay in political affairs. Masbate is sixty
leguas from Manila, in a latitude lying between twelve and thirteen
degrees. It is about fifty leguas in circumference, nineteen leguas
long and five or six broad. It was formerly famous for its rich gold
mines, which, when they tried later to work them, it was found did not
produce expenses. The island also has fine copper mines, samples from
which in very recent times were excellent. Information was given of
them by Don Francisco Salgado; and when everything necessary and expert
Chinese for working them had been prepared, he abandoned them, for he
saw that they had much less metal than he had thought. The island of
Ticao is about twenty-three leguas in circumference, nine long, and
more than four wide. That of Burias extends its circumference to
twenty-six leguas, twelve in length, and four in width. These
calculations must be understood only approximately, for they had not
been exactly determined. All three possess excellent timber, from which
pitch is distilled in plenty, and makes excellent pitch for vessels.
One of those trees produces the fragrant <i>camanguian</i>;<a class= 
"noteref" id="xd0e2130src" href="#xd0e2130">64</a> another very
abundantly a kind of almond, larger than that of Europa, for which it
is mistaken in taste. They have many civet-cats; civet is a drug which
was obtained there long before this <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb243" href="#pb243">243</a>]</span>time, and had a good sale in
Acapulco, although that product is not in so great demand now.</p>

<p>2. Don Luis Henrriquez de Guzman, a knight of Sevilla, reduced those
islands to the crown of Espa&ntilde;a in the year one thousand five
hundred and sixty-nine. Their conquest was finished and they were left
thoroughly subdued by Captain Andres de Ybarra. Protected by arms,
father Fray Alonso Ximenez, an Observant Augustinian, introduced the
evangelical law. In that he did excellent work and obtained much fruit
in Masbate. Other religious, imbued with the same spirit and of the
same institute, followed, and spread the work into Ticao and Burias. By
that means a suitable mission field was established, and the
Augustinians conserved the administration thereof until the year six
hundred and nine. At that time they resigned that district into the
hands of the bishop of Camarines, who employed seculars instead of
those regulars. There were various seculars in charge of the
administration there, until the year one thousand six hundred and
eighty-eight. The district handed over by the Augustinian fathers had
two hundred and fifty regular families; but that number was diminished
by the terrible invasions of the Moros, so that the corresponding
stipend was not sufficient for the maintenance of one cura, and no one
could be found who was willing to take care of that district. On that
account his Excellency, Master Don Fray Andres Gonzalez of the Order of
Preachers, their bishop, represented to his Majesty that it was
absolutely necessary to apportion the curacies in another manner for
the just spiritual administration of his bishopric, by placing some of
them in the charge of regulars; and he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb244" href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>petitioned that his Majesty
approve his new plan, by ordering his governor of those islands to
proceed in it as vice-patron. The king consented to what the prelate
asked, and despatched his royal decree, under date of Madrid, August
thirteen, eighty-five. With that order his Excellency presented to the
governor the new distribution of districts, with the changes necessary
and fitting. In that distribution he applied all the ministry of
Masbate to the province of San Nicolas of the Augustinian Recollects,
and also on the mainland of Luzon the villages of Ingoso, Catanavan,
and Vig&ograve; with its neighboring rancher&iacute;as, of which was
formed the curacy of Piris. The governor, Don Gabriel Curuzalaegui, by
an act of November twenty-six, of eighty-six, approved the plan
conceived by his Excellency the bishop, and informed the said Recollect
fathers of the part of the distribution that pertained to them. They
accepted the assigned administration. In the territory on the mainland
disputes were imminent with the Franciscan fathers in regard to the
ownership of those territories. Accordingly the Recollects only
accepted the district of Masbate, and resigned the right that they
could have had to the village on the continent of Luzon to the
Franciscan fathers, who could administer them with greater ease. By
that means all rivalry was checked.</p>

<p>3. The parties [<i>i.e.</i>, the Recollects and Franciscans] having
come to an agreement, and between themselves the governor and bishop,
the two latter despatched suitable measures so that the Recollects
could take charge of those souls. In the distribution the Recollects
had their proportionate advantages, for those islands are a way-station
which is necessary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href=
"#pb245">245</a>]</span>to pass in going to Caraga and Zeb&ugrave;,
where this order had distant missions. The bishop obtained them [for
that order] because, that district having been reduced to one single
secular, the latter proved insufficient for its administration.
Consequently, in the space of twelve years, only four persons had died
with the sacraments, although one hundred and eighteen had passed from
this life without that important benefit. The baptism of children was
postponed for many months, as the cura went to the visitas in the
distant villages but seldom. For it was not easy for one single
individual to acquit himself of so laborious cares; consequently, this
is not to admit that they were ill administered. The government was
interested in them, as was also commerce, as Ticao was an anchorage for
the Acapulco ships in its famous port of San Jazinto,<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e2151src" href="#xd0e2151">65</a> on both the outward and return
trips, where fresh supplies were procured, wood and water provided, and
winds awaited to take them out of the dangerous currents of the
Embocadero of San Bernardino. The Recollect fathers accepted that
charge, and were received affectionately by the Indians. They founded
their headquarters in Mobo,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2157src" href= 
"#xd0e2157">66</a> a famous village of Masbate. They built a church
there, under the advocacy of Our Lady of Remedies. It was a costly
edifice, adorned with good reredoses, and had a sacristy well supplied
with vestments, besides a capacious house with its suitable quarters
and dormitories for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href=
"#pb246">246</a>]</span>the resident and transient religious. Thence
they made their apostolic excursions for the conversion of the
heathens, who were still numerous, and the reduction of fugitive
apostates. The settlements already established numbered six, and three
new villages were established with the increase of those who settled
down.</p>

<p>4. This province of San Nicolas petitioned his Majesty in the year
one thousand seven hundred and twenty-four to confirm that possession
which had been conferred on it in his royal name. His Majesty ordered
the governor of Philipinas and the bishop of Nueva Caceres to make no
innovation in the spiritual administration of that district until his
royal Council should provide what was suitable. He also ordered them to
report on the progress of the faith in that territory since it had been
under their charge. Judicial investigations were made in Manila by the
government, in order to inform the king with reports. From them it
appeared that, although the entire district of Masbate had formerly had
only one parish priest, since the Recollect fathers had taken charge of
it, three religious at least had lived there. It was proved also by the
books of the royal accountancy, that in the year preceding their
possession, that is, in the year eighty-seven, the entire ministry
contained only one hundred and eighty-seven families; while in the year
seven hundred and twenty-two there were five hundred and eighty-five
families. Consequently, the present governor, the Marqu&iacute;s de
Torre Campo, reported that the district of Masbate had had an increase
of three hundred and ninety-eight whole tributes through the apostolic
zeal of those ministers. The Recollects not only in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247">247</a>]</span>those districts,
but also in the remainder of these islands, devote themselves to the
spread of our holy Catholic faith with the greatest toil and with the
most visible fruit.</p>

<p>5. That progress was not made without great toil and hardship. They
had to do with a great number of mountain Indians and Zimarrones, who
became fearsome when abandoned to liberty. Apostates from the faith and
from civilized life, they had taken to the deserts and to the roughest
mountains, where they defended their barbarous mode of life at all
hazards, by resisting with arms those who tried to reduce them. Various
people had also gathered there from other islands, fleeing from the
settled villages and from the punishment due their atrocities.
Consequently, the latter were extraordinarily fierce. Many heathen were
numbered among them, accustomed long since to that rudeness of life and
savagery, and they were all the worst kind of people. They committed
notable depredations on the civilized villages, robbed the boats that
anchored in the ports and bays, and treacherously committed many
murders. Their boldness rose to such a pitch that one could not cross
through the interior of those islands, and to arrive at their shores
was the same as to make port in a land of enemies. It was also a
laborious and dangerous task to navigate along the coasts, trying to
find those rancher&iacute;as. Consequently, Father Fray Ildefonso de la
Concepcion was twice overturned in the sea, and another time had his
boat dashed to pieces on some reefs. In that shipwreck he miraculously
escaped with his life, although some of his companions perished in the
water. Those dangers came to him in his visits to a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248">248</a>]</span>new village
established on the opposite coast. In order to avoid such dangers and
visit that village more frequently, the father opened a road through
the interior from Mobo over rough mountains, where many other risks
were run because of the heathens. In that continual crossing the father
fell grievously sick, his pains having originated from the hardships of
such a road, with the showers and heat. He died at last, succumbing to
such fatigues. But those sufferings were continued by others, who
conquered that stubbornness by their constancy and fervent application,
although with the well-known risk of losing their lives. Consequently,
those ministers who were there in the beginning say that, although they
have been many years in other doctrinas and missions, they had not so
much to suffer and endure in any of them as in that of Masbate.</p>

<h4 class="normal">Chapter IV</h4>

<p><i>By sentence of the royal Audiencia, the province of Zambales is
restored to its first conquistadors, the discalced Augustinian
Recollect fathers.</i></p>

<p>1. The Zambal Indians, of an intractable disposition, people of wild
customs, and little or not at all content, were furious with the
Dominican ministers in the reductions; they were groaning under the
yoke of a life more regulated than their inclinations permitted. This
made them think of insurrections and uprisings. The presidio of
Painaven, well re&euml;nforced, restrained them; and the raids of the
commandant, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href=
"#pb249">249</a>]</span>with detachments of men, into the mountains,
intimidated them in their plans. They thought that the government of
the Recollect fathers was milder, and hence they sighed for it. Those
fathers tolerated their barbarous customs among a people so ferocious,
and succeeded by their patience in softening and reducing them. Not so
with the Dominican fathers, who learned the Zambals&rsquo; tenacity at
their own cost. In the village of Balacbac was an Indian chief named
Dalinen; although he lived in that village, he kept his valuables in
the mountains under charge of a nephew. Another Indian, a Cimarron,
named Calignao, killed the latter treacherously. In order to avenge
that murder, Dalinen retired with many of his followers to the dense
woods. Father Fray Domingo Perez,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2189src"
href="#xd0e2189">67</a> who was the minister of that mission, tried to
prevent that flight, but was quite unable to remedy it; for seventeen
families fled with Dalinen. The commandant of the fort attacked <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250">250</a>]</span>them with
his men and burned the rancher&iacute;a of Aglao, the next village to
Balacbac, to which the murderer and the injured man belonged.</p>

<p>2. Calignao had an extensive and strong kindred. Because they did
not flee with him, father Fray Domingo endeavored to win them over. He
asked for an adjutant&rsquo;s staff from the commandant of the fort,
and dignified Calignao with it. Then in order to restrain the other
side, it was published that the murder of the nephew [of Dalinen] was
by the command of the government, which had ordered that all who would
not reduce themselves to village life should be killed. That method,
however, was insufficient to quiet them, but, on the contrary, roused
the factions to a higher pitch. To please the commandant and to give
stronger force to his faction, Calignao promised to assault Dalinen. He
went into the mountain to put that promise into execution, and after a
short time, Dalinen was killed by a Negrito. His relatives were
persuaded that the father had had a hand in that murder, and determined
to pay him back. The same Calignao offered to do the deed, for this is
what it means to benefit apostatized evil-doers. He sought an opportune
occasion for the execution of his wicked intent, and found it in a
journey which the father made to Baubuen to visit a communal house
which he was building for strangers, and in order to confess father
Fray Juan de Rois,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2201src" href=
"#xd0e2201">68</a> who was the minister there. During the <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251">251</a>]</span>absence of the
father, Calignao descended the mountain, visited his relatives, and was
informed that the minister would return in three days. He left his
relatives, and in company with a faithless Negrito went to await the
father at the bank of a large river, by which it was necessary to pass.
When Father Perez reached that place, Calignao discharged an arrow,
which passed before the father&rsquo;s breast without doing him any
harm and lodged in a neighboring tree. When the father quite naturally
turned his head to see who was firing at him, the Negrito Quibacat
discharged his arrow, which, entering the father&rsquo;s body three
fingers below the left breast, came out more than four fingers at the
right side of his back. It was a twisted arrow, and when father Fray
Domingo pulled on it, the wound became worse. With the most intense
pain that he suffered, he broke out into &ldquo;Jesus, be with me! Let
them commend me to God, for I am dying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3. He spurred on his horse, which ran until the father perceived
that sight was failing him. Then he alighted, stretched himself at the
foot of an agoso tree,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2213src" href= 
"#xd0e2213">69</a> and, amid the outpouring of his blood, begged pardon
from God for his sins. An Indian who accompanied him came up to him,
and found him unconscious from great loss of blood. The father <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252">252</a>]</span>recovered
consciousness, but for so brief a time that he could not tell the
Indian what to do. He fainted once more, so completely that the Indian
thought that he was yielding up his life. He again recovered
consciousness, and sent the servant to <span class="corr" id="xd0e2227"
title="Source: Balabac">Balacbac</span> in order to get people to carry
him thence. The Indian went to carry out that instruction. Meanwhile a
man and three women arrived, and stayed with the father until the
arrival of the men from the village who were very slow. For the Indian
who had been sent could find no one who cared to take that charitable
office upon himself, either the ministers of justice, the fiscals, or
the sacristans. He was able to get three serving-lads in the convent,
who made a hammock from a blanket, and carried the wounded religious in
it. The latter, charging his messenger to go to Baubuen to advise
Father Rois of his mishap, set out on his way to his village, where he
arrived at nine o&rsquo;clock at night. Father Rois, as soon as he
received the news, got ready to go to the relief of his associate.
After many frights, for everything was in an uproar, and his person ran
no less risk [than that of Father Domingo], he reached the village at
daybreak. He entered the cell of the wounded father, whom he found
embracing a holy crucifix, and bathed in tears. Father Rois asked him
&ldquo;What is this, Father Vicar-prior?&rdquo; &ldquo;This means
death,&rdquo; answered the sufferer. &ldquo;I shall die; there is no
relief.&rdquo; He was confessed, and received the sacred viaticum. He
lived three days after that, without having his bed made, for his
extreme pains would not permit it. Had they tended him well at the
beginning, he would have recovered, for the wound was not mortal, and
the Indians have medicines <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href= 
"#pb253">253</a>]</span>which cure other things more dangerous. But the
greatest care was not exercised in this. The third day after nightfall,
the pains attacked him much more fiercely, and convulsions and
paroxysms followed. He received extreme unction, after which he lost
his speech, and remained remarkably quiet; and in that calm he yielded
his spirit to the Creator.</p>

<p>4. The malicious Calignao, after having wounded the father, went to
Balacbac, and made an effort to enter the convent in order to kill the
servants of father Fray Domingo. The servants barred the doors on the
inside until the wounded father arrived, and during all the three days
while the latter lived, the murderer remained in the village, without
anyone daring to raise a hand against him. During that time Calignao
assaulted the convent several times, but could effect nothing, because
of the vigilance of Father Rois. The commandant of the fort desired to
go in person to punish the treachery, but he was prevented from it by
the other religious, for the reason that if he were killed the fort was
in danger; and, if that presidio were captured by the Zambals, there
would not be a father or a Spaniard in Playahonda who would not be
sacrificed to their fury. He sent indeed a detachment of men, with
orders to arrest or kill Calignao; but they were unable to do so, as
all the village was interested in his liberty. They were present at the
funeral, which took place in the church on the following day, with all
possible propriety. A year and a half later the father&rsquo;s bones
were moved to the church of his convent at Manila.</p>

<p>5. It is said that God honored the place of his death or where he
was wounded, by marvelous occurrences. For instance the large river on
whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href=
"#pb254">254</a>]</span>shore he was shot, dried up, and was swallowed
up by the earth, and no trace of it was ever found later, neither did
it take a course elsewhere; while the bed of the river became full of
agoso trees. And although the above tree is large, and needs more than
ten years to grow tall, those trees grew up in so short a time that
that place appeared a dense forest, so that they choked and parched the
reed-grass, which never sprang up again. It was said that the earth
which was dyed with his blood has never allowed any grass to grow
since, although the grass about the agoso at whose foot the father
fainted is abundant and very green. That tree is always more
flourishing and luxuriant, so that in comparison with it the other
trees seem like withered things. Also another smaller river which ran
past Aglao and Baubuen dried up, and the earth was left very sterile.
It is true that these things were said, but without any foundation. The
large river still remains and flows in the same course, and that of
Aglao has the same course, and there is no notice or tradition that it
had ever dried up; and it is not possible that so remarkable a thing
could be forgotten. It was true that the agoso under which he rested
was preserved and is still preserved; but in that story are not
registered the exaggerated circumstances, such as that of the grass and
of the reed-grass. I say this with assurance because I have seen it at
various times, and I have passed the large river with some risk. On the
bank of that river I was shown the spot where the father was wounded,
and the agoso in question, in which I found nothing worthy of wonder.
In regard to the other agosos and those newly produced, I proved that
there are both old and new <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href= 
"#pb255">255</a>]</span>trees, for they are produced without any
cultivation, and are conserved from time immemorial, and their very
great age is recognized by their failing condition.<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e2240src" href="#xd0e2240">70</a></p>

<p>6. The Augustinian Recollect fathers, who had not left that
administration [of Zambales] voluntarily, although they could not
resist the change with Mindoro, asked for testimonies that they might
present them at court. They protested in due form, and appointed
ministers in their chapters, of whose election they apprised the
Dominican fathers in legal form. Their recourse to court had the result
that the parties [in the matter] were referred by the Council of the
Indias to this royal Audiencia. The testimonies were brought to it, and
it became sufficiently public. On that account the father
procurator-general of the Order of St. Dominic, Fray Juan Peguero<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e2248src" href="#xd0e2248">71</a> appeared
before the superior government. He stated that his Excellency the
archbishop <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href=
"#pb256">256</a>]</span>and the governor had removed the Order of the
Augustinian Recollects from the province of Zambales for reasons that
they considered just, necessary, or reasonable, in accordance with the
rulings of the laws of the new <i lang="es">Recopilaci&oacute;n</i>,<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e2259src" href="#xd0e2259">72</a> and had given
it to his province, they on their part having first made no efforts to
get it. His order had received it only that they might serve God and
the king. The Recollect fathers had received the island of Mindoro as a
recompense, without offering any objection, and had expressly given up
their rights to the province of Zambales. Nevertheless father Fray Juan
de la Madre de Dios had presented a writing before the supreme Council,
which was sent to this royal Audiencia, where as yet, more than eight
months after the arrival of the galleons at the islands, it did not
appear to have been presented. Without petitioning in any tribunal, [he
said], a rumor was spread to the discredit of his province and to the
prejudice of the propagation of the faith among the Zambals. The
latter, in the hope which they had received from their former ministers
that they would soon return to take charge of them, were fleeing to the
mountains to become infidels, apostates, and idolaters, as they were
formerly. Consequently, the ministers of his province found themselves
hindered in the conversions and the administrations of the sacraments,
as they were so disturbed that it was necessary for the commandant of
the fort to seize some persons who returned from Manila and spread such
a report. Not even this was a sufficient relief for the continual
flights of the natives. On that account <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb257" href="#pb257">257</a>]</span>he petitioned his Lordship, in the
name of his province, to be pleased to employ suitable means, and what
he believed best, for the avoidance of those scandals. His Lordship
furnished a copy of the judicial proceedings<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e2267src" href="#xd0e2267">73</a> to the Recollect side, ordering
that they, with the reply that they should make, should give account of
the royal decree mentioned in the allegation [aforesaid, by Fray Juan
de la Madre de Dios]. Notification of this was communicated, on May 2,
1685, to father Fray Joseph de Jesus Maria, procurator-general of the
discalced religious of St. Augustine. The latter said that he heard it
and would answer in due form.</p>

<p>7. He did so, and presented himself with the copy authorized in
public form, of the proceedings of the royal and supreme Council of the
Indias in the cause prosecuted by the father procurator-general, Fray
Juan de la Madre de Dios, asking that his province should be restored
to its former possession of the ministries of Mariveles, Masinloc,
Bolinao, Puquil, and Playa-honda, and the rest of the province of
Zambales. The decision thereon, as appeared from the said proceedings,
was referred to the royal Audiencia of Manila. In regard to the
contents of Father Peguero&rsquo;s memorial, notwithstanding what he
might petition, it should be refuted as outside the truth, as a
calumny, and as grievously offensive to his province&mdash;which with
excessive and continual work, and equal zeal in the service of both
Majesties, had assisted in the administration of the Christians and the
conversion of the infidels in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258"
href="#pb258">258</a>]</span>aforesaid districts, from the year one
thousand six hundred and seven to the year one thousand six hundred and
seventy-nine, when it was despoiled actually and contrary to law, and
the Dominican religious introduced into those missions. Notwithstanding
the above, the said memorial, proceeding by malicious reports, and with
a lack of accurate information, says that in the year seventy-six the
said Father Peguero informed the government of these islands that the
conversion and reduction of the Zambals&mdash;both the
light-complexioned ones and those with the kinky hair, on both sides of
the mountains that extend from Batan to Pangasinan, especially in the
localities of Aglao, Buquil, Alupay, and Culianan, and many
others&mdash;had not been thitherto in charge of any of the orders of
these islands. In consideration of that, he petitioned that that care
be assigned to his order. Despatches were given him in accordance with
the terms of his petition, without summoning the party of the Recollect
province, which was in possession [of that territory] from the time
mentioned above. That order was then especially extending its labors,
and working in the reduction of the infidels of those very same places,
and in the administration of a great number of Christians in those
districts, who paid tribute to their encomenderos. His order having
offered opposition, and having made a petition before the royal
Audiencia to be protected in its ancient possession, this was done, and
the Order of St. Dominic was excluded from its demand, as appeared from
royal provision and proceedings, which would be presented if it were
necessary. After his order had been placed in charge of <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259">259</a>]</span>the
administration of Mindoro, the Dominicans succeeded in getting the
governor, then Don Juan de Vargas, to ask the father provincial, Fray
Joseph de San Nicolas, to make a renunciation [of those districts]. The
father provincial did it unwillingly, for it was a thing that he
neither could or ought to do in regard to such districts, in order that
other religious might be instituted&mdash;as were those of St. Dominic,
in the year eighty. Two grave [Recollect] religious protested in the
name of their province, against the renunciation made by their
Recollect provincial; and all the ministers of Zambales protested
against the violence with which they were despoiled of that
administration, without their province having until then made any other
judicial or extrajudicial effort than the conservation of their right,
in order to demand it where and to what extent it may behoove them to
do so. The provincial of his province had formally ordered his subjects
not only not to solicit the natives of those districts to ask for, or
allow them to ask for, these or other ministers; but they were to
admonish them always to live consoled and contented, and to understand
that the instruction which they received from the fathers of St.
Dominic was the same, and [given with] the same zeal for the welfare of
their souls. That order was obeyed, and there was no notice of its
infraction. On the contrary, information was received that the present
Dominican ministers told the natives that they were returning to carry
forward what had been commenced by the Recollects. That proved that the
Recollects did not keep their convents and churches, which they had
abandoned to the Dominicans; as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260"
href="#pb260">260</a>]</span>does the suggestion that father Fray
Raymundo Verart<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2283src" href=
"#xd0e2283">74</a> said that Captain Marcos de Rosales, encomendero of
Marivelez, had made to him, for the latter earnestly entreated him to
ask that the Recollects should be restored to the possession of those
ministeries. He offered to make that request to him in writing.</p>

<p>8. Even though the religious of his province had represented to
those natives that they would return to their ancient administration,
one could not argue from that that any injury to the propagation of the
faith, or to the credit of so holy an order [<i>i.e.</i>, the
Dominican] would follow, as the memorial declared&mdash;in formal
prejudice to his own order [<i>i.e.</i>, the Recollect] (in regard to
which that order was protesting, in order to demand whatever was proper
for its side). The proposed hopes of the restoration, however, would
hinder the flight of the natives, which, it was known, proceeded from
other reasons, through a great part of the villages of Zambales having
been depopulated. That they had been living in idolatry from their
first conversion, besides <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href= 
"#pb261">261</a>]</span>being an implicatory proposition, did not
appear from the sentence of a competent tribunal, nor was it credible
of all. And it was no new thing, that after some years, a few
superstitions should be discovered [among the Indians], as was usually
the case, and happened at every step; for it was not an easy thing to
reduce mountain infidels to a civilized life, in which task the
ministers must acquire thorough knowledge of their customs.
Consequently, it had been impossible to eradicate their barbarous
ferocity in committing murders, as they had done to a religious of the
Order of St. Dominic. And because his province had shirked no labor for
the service of God and the king, in the welfare of souls, especially in
the administration of the Zambals during the space of sixty years, it
desired to reap the fruit [of the harvest] that had been commenced;
wherefore in furtherance of its claim he prayed his Lordship to order
and command that the pleadings which had been presented be referred to
the royal Audiencia, to the end that whatever should be ruled therein
be considered as law. The decree enacted (with the opinion of the
assessor) was, that the cognizance of the entire matter be referred to
the royal Audiencia, so that the parties to the suit might there plead
their claims in equity, and in fulfilment of the decree of the supreme
Council of the Indias. The Recollect procurator general having been
notified, appeared before the royal Audiencia with his claim together
with the rest of the papers annexed, which, having been presented, were
considered as referred to that tribunal for official action therein.
Notice of that decision having been given to father Fray Juan Peguero,
he said that he heard it, and pleaded <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb262" href="#pb262">262</a>]</span>that the papers be given him for
his reply as was done. But I shall not give his answer here, because of
the irregularity of his pleadings, his rashness of speech, his boldness
of opinion, and his disrespect for the royal power, since his Majesty
does not allow causes to be conducted in rude fashion, especially when
they do not bear on the case in point, while personal defects of
ecclesiastics were not under consideration in the present case, nor in
the cause which was being prosecuted, as it concerned ministries
only.</p>

<p>9. In conclusion his reply was that while maintaining the contrary
of what was advanced by the Recollect fathers, as their province was
not a party [to the suit]; he petitions and prays that his Highness
deign to issue a citation on the party [of the Recollects], to the end
that an investigation be made of all the aforesaid, as was necessary,
and becoming, etc. The ruling was that the decree be communicated to
the father procurator of the Recollects, who answered as follows,
namely, that he acknowledged the indecorous manner in which, in view of
the sovereignty of the royal Audiencia, the good name of his side and
his subjects was injured. But that although he could answer point by
point, he would avoid doing so, as it was a matter in which, leaving
aside the requirements of law, which were to be complied with, the
subject matter was getting to be a bone of contention, and a
partisanship dispute&mdash;a matter which ought to be held in
abhorrence by religious, who are placed as models for all in these
regions, and because law enjoins the manner in which one ought to speak
in the royal courts of justice, where it is expressly forbidden to
bring forward incriminating libels in place of actions of laws; for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263">263</a>]</span>these
wound not only the sacredness of the religious orders, but even the
sovereignty of such a tribunal, to which is due the highest respect. On
that account they ought to order the withdrawal of the two allegations
presented by Father Peguero as being indecorous, and notice ought to be
given to the said father to answer as was fitting, by representing the
authority that his province had in the administration of Zambales; in
default of which, the court was to record them as having been duly
pleaded. To this motion, the gentlemen [of the Audiencia] agreed that
the decree should issue, and the clerk of the assembly summoned the
said Father Peguero in due form for the examination, who thereupon
refused such style of procedure until he had presented his grounds for
opposing such action [<i>i.e.</i>, the above decision of the
Audiencia].</p>

<p>10. The said father procurator pleaded before his Highness that
Doctor Calderon, the senior auditor, during his week had refused to
sign a paper in which he [<i>i.e.</i>, the Recollect
procurator-general], pleaded in regard to the pending article; and
having been ordered to present himself in the royal Audiencia, he did
this by means of two religious at a time when the said doctor was the
only member present in the Audiencia, because of the illness of his
associate judges. There a decree was entered which ordered that the
writ and other papers pertaining to this matter be presented by a
procurator of the royal Audiencia, who could be punished in default for
his negligence. And in view of the fact that he considered this measure
burdensome and harmful to his order and person, as he was condemned
before sentence was passed on the point, and the order was <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264">264</a>]</span>prevented from
prosecuting this or any other cause in the royal courts, because of
their well-known poverty, he prayed his Highness to deign to repeal the
said act, and to allow his province the liberty of having it prosecuted
by its own prosecutors. A decree to that effect was passed and the
trial set for the first day, when the said Doctor Don Diego Calderon
should be present.</p>

<p>11. The auditor, in order to justify his act in the royal Audiencia,
related that Father Peguero had brought a paper to his house for him to
fill out to the effect that the petition, which as he declared, he was
going to present to the royal courts, should come before him, the said
auditor, during his week; and that in consideration of the fact that it
was a matter that concerned priests against priests, of religious
missionaries against religious of the same institute, it could not set
forth allegations that were wanting in fraternal charity and profound
humility. This he signed without reading it, while charging the father
procurator to present it in the royal courts, as was done on the day
when his Lordship was the only member present [in the Audiencia]. The
petition was granted and an order issued to have the papers served on
the Recollect father procurator, who was bid to file his answer
thereto; furthermore, in order to determine this point, the abovesaid
auditor ordered that the case so far as concerned the examination of
the same be laid before him. Peguero, not content with what was done,
presented another petition in regard to the same cause, that it might
be signed officially and passed. But having glanced over it, he found
that this should not be done, as it contained other unbecoming
expressions based on the one that had been presented previously, <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265">265</a>]</span>and therein
at variance with the laws and ordinances of the royal Audiencia,
wherefore he told the said father procurator to hand his petition back
and present it when all the members [of the Audiencia] were assembled.
The result was that their illness still continuing, two lay-brethren,
religious of the Order of Preachers, entered the chamber and requested
that the petition that they presented be granted, which was the same as
had been presented by the father procurator Peguero, in which his
Highness was able to recognize the irregularity of the statements, and
his inability to sanction such proceedings, through his desire for
public peace, and to the end that such holy orders be not embarrassed
with injurious writs. Consequently, in order to prevent disrespectful
petitions from being presented in those tribunals, his Highness had to
decree what was most in consonance with loyalty to both their
Majesties, and the public peace.</p>

<p>12. This decree was as follows: &ldquo;Decision of the royal court
this day, September eleven, one thousand seven hundred and five.<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e2324src" href="#xd0e2324">75</a> The measure
passed by Se&ntilde;or Calderon is approved, and in accordance
therewith, a decree to that effect shall be issued. Because of their
great poverty, only the first petitions of the Indians shall be
received without attorney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>13. The decree so enacted had the effect that the office of
procurator-general of the province of Santissimo Rosario was changed
and given to father Fray Domingo Escalera,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e2329src" href="#xd0e2329">76</a> who together with the <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href=
"#pb266">266</a>]</span>procurator-general of the Recollects, presented
a joint petition to his Highness to deign to have the preceding writs
annulled, as they were not suitable and germane to the case, nor
respectful to the royal Audiencia and the parties [in the suit]. This
was handed to the fiscal for review, who said that, because of their
joint agreement, and moreover, because the writs were not germane to
the case in the chief point of the pending suit, greater harmony would
result to the two orders which were at law, and to the public cause,
and that if the writs were juridically annulled because of their
contents, his Highness could order the execution of what the parties
petitioned, and such decree would be valid and efficacious&mdash;an
opinion however that had no definitive result. Then in regard to the
writ presented by the Recollect procurator Father Escalera rejoined
that, inasmuch as such ministries were handed to his province by the
government, if his Highness were pleased to order that they be restored
to the plaintiff province his province was ready to do its part, and
for that purpose he renounced this copy <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb267" href="#pb267">267</a>]</span>of the proceedings, and any other,
as he had nothing to petition or plead. Therefore, in consideration of
the decrees already passed in which he considered himself as cited, his
Highness should deign to issue an order for whatever should be his
pleasure. Consequently, a decree was drawn up embodying the ordinances
that had been made in which the parties were recorded as having been
cited, as they considered themselves as cited, and the Recollect
procurator presented proofs to the effect that his province had never
renounced such ministries, but had always violently protested against
the fact of their having been despoiled thereof, in support of which it
had been prosecuting the cause in the Council. For the Dominicans,
their prior provincial, father Fray Christoval Pedroche, answered the
citation by saying that his province had held those ministries in
encomienda and trust in the name of his Majesty through the
vice-patron, and consequently, if any act of spoliation had been
committed, his province was not a party thereto, just as it was not a
party to the present proceedings. Therefore he was ready to return them
whenever his Highness so ordered; and hence he did not oppose the claim
of the Recollect fathers. In answer to their statement that they had
elected priors for those missions in all their provincial chapters, and
that therein they had no other consideration than the service of God in
those missions and the spiritual welfare of souls, he petitioned that
his province be adjudged as not a party in the said suit, protesting
moreover that he would not plead, or in any way oppose his
Highness&rsquo;s decision. When the parties were cited, an order was
issued by the court that with these decrees be united those <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268">268</a>]</span>which were
enacted by the master-of-camp, Don Juan de Vargas Hurtado, for the
assignment of the Zambals to the Dominican fathers. The decrees having
thus been brought together, various motions were made, in which
proceedings the Dominicans always by joint action refused to be
recognized as a party thereto. Whereupon the members of the court
having examined the proceedings after their previous examination by the
fiscal, declared, that notwithstanding the reply of the father
provincial of the Order of Preachers in which he petitioned that his
order be declared not to be a party, they maintained, as they now
maintained, that he was a legitimate party in these proceedings;
moreover that they ordered him, as they now repeated their order, that
he notify the father procurator-general of the said order to answer to
the summons within three days, and to make full return thereto. He was
also warned that if, at the expiration of said limit, he had not done
so, the royal courts would declare the proceedings so far as taken as
sufficient, and the case would be prosecuted in them. The Dominican
procurator having been cited and notified, said that he obeyed the
decree of his Highness, that he heard it, but that there was no answer
to be given, as he was not a party, as he had already declared, and
that in case that it was necessary he would repeat the same answer of
his father provincial. This occurrence took place on November
twenty-four, one thousand six hundred and ninety.</p>

<p>14. Thus this matter [<i lang="es">expediente</i>] rested until the
year one thousand seven hundred and ten, when the alf&eacute;rez,
Nicolas Guerrero, one of the ordinary attorneys of the royal Audiencia,
presented a certificate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href= 
"#pb269">269</a>]</span>empowering him as the chief authorized agent of
the province of San Nicolas, to act as their attorney in the matter in
hand. Thereupon, he declared that in maintenance of the claim of the
said province, it was advisable to examine the minutes of the
proceedings hitherto conducted in the royal courts, in regard to the
restitution of their former missions of Zambales and everything
pertaining to them. Accordingly, he prayed his Highness to deign to
order the secretary to produce the said minutes, which on being given
to the said attorney, he appeared before his Highness and stated that
in accordance with the last royal order of six hundred and ninety,
whereby the other party was required to answer fully, this had not been
done, but that the party had merely referred to its former pleadings,
and that any other answer had not been made during the space of twenty
years, so that the suit had been unduly prolonged; and moreover, that
the matter having been recently investigated, his side has a paper
(which he now presents with all solemnity), namely, a private letter
from the father provincial of the Dominicans, Fray Pedro Mejorada,<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e2350src" href="#xd0e2350">77</a> in reply to
one from the provincial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href= 
"#pb270">270</a>]</span>of the Recollects, Fray Francisco de la Madre
de Dios, in which he declares, that he answered in the same manner as
his province had done on former occasions; that he would not oppose the
abandoning of the said missions as he was not a party thereto, for his
province had taken these under their charge solely in compliance with
the orders of Governor Don Juan de Vargas and Archbishop Don Phelipe
Pardo; that, moreover, at the present time when his province was so
straitened through the lack of religious, if they were not succored in
that regard it would be necessary for them to take other steps.
Wherefore (he added), so far as matters have now gone he might do what
he pleased, for his province would offer no opposition, and was
prepared to give up those missions if so requested and charged to do.
In this letter, moreover, among other points, it was inferable that his
province was ready to leave the said missions of Zambales. Therefore
the attorney petitioned and prayed his Highness to deign to have the
case brought up for final trial, declaring his client as entitled to
the possession of such missions, to whom they should therefore be
restored. Thereupon the judges decided that the measures so far taken
together with that letter should be acted upon; that the trial should
be proceeded with without prejudice to whatever had already been
decided, and that all the papers in the case be handed over to the
fiscal of this royal Audiencia, for his opinion (within three days) of
what steps it was advisable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href= 
"#pb271">271</a>]</span>to take. Thereupon, for reasons given, the
latter replied that what had been advised by the fiscal of the royal
and supreme Council ought to be carried out, and hence a similar order
might issue from this royal Audiencia, with notice to the reverend
fathers provincial, parties in interest, that so far as concerned their
spiritual care the natives might be relieved promptly. In accordance
with this, the judges ordered that all parties should proceed to the
chamber for final sentence. Thereupon their decision was that the
reverend fathers provincial should be apprised of the sentence as given
in this cause for their judgment in the exercise of their rights; and
that whether they assented or not, they should appear to hear the
decision to be given.</p>

<p>15. The parties being notified, and a report of the proceedings
having been proclaimed, sentence was then given as follows: &ldquo;In
the city of Manila, October twenty-two, one thousand seven hundred and
twelve: The president and auditors of the royal Audiencia and
Chancilleria of these islands assembled in the royal courts thereof,
having examined in relation the proceedings prosecuted on the part of
the Recollect province and religious of San Nicolas de Tolentino of
these islands, against the province of Santo Rosario and the religious
of St. Dominic in regard to the restitution of the spiritual
administration of the natives of the province of Zambales, hereupon
declared that they ought to restore&mdash;and they hereby have
restored&mdash;to the said Recollect province, and religious of San
Nicolas of these islands the spiritual administration of the natives of
Zambales, in the same manner as they held it at the time when the very
reverend and devout father provincial of the said order, Fray Joseph de
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272">272</a>]</span>San
Nicolas de Tolentino, resigned, handed over, and separated them from
his administration in the former year one thousand six hundred and
seventy-nine. In consequence whereof they moreover ordered&mdash;and
they have so ordered&mdash;that there be made out in due form for the
party of the said Order of San Nicolas a warrant to that effect. Thus
was it decreed, ordered, and subscribed to in the presence of his
Majesty&rsquo;s fiscal.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Doctor Torralva</span><br>

 <span class="smallcaps">The Fiscal</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the presence of Antonio de Yepes y Arce, notary-public. Their
decision was heard and obeyed promptly by the party to the suit, and
proper warrants having been received, the spiritual administration of
the Zambals was peacefully restored to the province of San Nicolas of
the Augustinian Recollects. Perhaps the very reverend father
chronicler, Fray Domingo Collantes,<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2382src"
href="#xd0e2382">78</a> did not have at hand these original documents
when he penned the fourth part of the chronicles of his province of
Santissimo Rosario which has been recently published; and this must be
the reason for the so great diversity in the [story of the] restoration
of Zambales, and for the minuteness with which it is discussed
here.</p>

the Dominican convent of Valladolid, July 13, 1639. As he showed
evident signs of a brilliant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e746"
href="#xd0e746">77n</a>]</span>mind he was sent to the college of San
Gregorio of Valladolid, after graduating from which he returned to the
convent as lecturer in philosophy. Thence he went to the convent of
Trianos as master of students, but later joining the Philippine mission
arrived at those islands in 1658. Destined for the instruction of the
Chinese he was sent to the Chinese missions as soon as he had mastered
the language. His two years in China were years of continual suffering,
imprisonment, and torment. Recalled, although against his will, to
become procurator for his province in Madrid and Rome, and to act as
definitor in the general chapter, he gave up his mission work. Always
of a humble and obedient disposition, when he was ordered to return
immediately to Spain on one occasion after he had just conducted a
mission to Mexico, he obeyed without hesitation, but he had scarcely
reached the convent at Sevilla, when he died, December 2, 1671. At the
chapter held at Rome 1668, he petitioned the beatification of the
Japanese martyrs. See <i lang="es">Rese&ntilde;a biogr&aacute;fica</i>,

Bavarian. Educated at the university at Salamanca, he took the Jesuit
habit in the same city in 1614. He became known for his learning and
ability and for fourteen years filled the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

the scriptures. At the same time he was held in high esteem as a
confessor, and was solicited by many prominent people as such. In 1642,
he gave up teaching entirely because of an attack of paralysis. His
death occurred at Madrid, April 7, 1658. He was the author of many
works in Spanish and Latin, some of which have been translated into

differentiated from the province of Rombl&oacute;n, which contains a
number of islands, and has a population of 52,848. The Calamianes or
Culi&oacute;n group is located in the southwestern part of the
archipelago between Mindoro and Paragua between lat. 11&deg; 39&prime;
and 12&deg; 20&prime; N., and long. 119&deg; 47&prime; and 120&deg;

of well over 100 islands, islets, and mere rocks, many of them unnamed.
The largest islands in the group are Busuanga, Calamian, and Linacapan.
The population of Calamianes is given as follows for a number of years:
1876, 16,403; 1885, 21,573; 1886, 17,594; 1887, 16,016; 1888, 14,739;

1895, 16,186; 1896, 15,620; 1897, 15,661; 1898, 14,283. While the
falling off in later years may be accounted for possibly by the
movements of population during the insurrectionary period, it must be
assumed that the returns for the earlier years are incorrect, for they
would not naturally vary so greatly from year to year. See <i>U. S.

born in Santa Justa near Santander, in 1636. Entering the convent at
Santillana, he professed as a Dominican there, October 14, 1659.
Refusing the offer of a college education in Alcal&aacute; de Henares,
he went to the Philippines, after teaching philosophy for a time at
Mexico. Reaching Manila in December 1666, he taught philosophy until
the following year, when he was assigned to the province of
Bata&aacute;n, at the convent of Oriong, which was declared independent
of Abucay in that same year. Three of his five years there he acted as
vicar. From Oriong he went to Sam&aacute;l, and thence to Abucay in
1675. Somewhat later he was sent to Balacbac, but remained there but a
short time because of the complaints of the Recollects, who claimed
that the Dominicans were usurping their territory. In 1677 he was
appointed vicar of Abucay, where his capacity for work and his zeal
were conspicuous. In 1678 he was appointed vicar of Binondoc, remaining
there one year. When the Dominicans were given charge of the province
of Zambales in 1679, he was made vicar of that whole district. He was
conspicuous throughout the province for his efforts in destroying idol
worship, and his opposition to that and all manner of vices finally
ended in his murder, as related <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e2191"
href="#xd0e2191">236n</a>]</span>in the text. He died on November 15,
1683. He was the author of a relation on the customs and superstitions
of the Zambals, which existed in the Dominican archives at Manila. See

1679. Arriving at the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e2203" href= 
"#xd0e2203">237n</a>]</span>Philippines that same year, he was assigned
in 1680 to the house at Masinloc, and in 1682 to that at Nueva Toledo.
In 1684 he was again assigned to Masinloc, and in 1686 became vicar of
Paynaven and vicar-provincial of Zambales. He was sent to the Batanes
Islands with Father Mateo Gonz&aacute;lez, in 1688, where he died that
same year from the unhealthfulness of the region and his hardships. See

After arriving in the Philippines, he was assigned to the province of
Bata&aacute;n, where he labored in the convents of Samal and Abucay. He
was associate in Binondoc during the years 1671&ndash;1673, when he
became vicar of San Juan del Monte, serving also in the latter in 1680
and 1686&ndash;1691. He was vicar of Oriong 1677&ndash;1680, and became
procurator, along with his other duties, in the latter year. His death
occurred at the Manila convent, May 21, 1691. He wrote a compendium of
the history of the province, and a biography of Domingo P&eacute;rez,
the latter of which he dated and signed on February 1, 1691, and which
was conserved in the Dominican convent at Manila. One of his works was
to construct an aqueduct from the Pasig for the better water-supply of
Manila, but an earthquake totally destroyed his work. See <i lang="es">

Manila at the age of twenty-eight, in the year 1679. He speedily became
associate to the archbishop, Felipe Pardo, in whose defense he wrote
several <i lang="es">manifestos</i> which remain in MS. In 1681 the
ecclesiastical cabildo asked that the archbishop give him up, and
probably in answer to that demand, he was assigned to the convent of
Abucay in the province of Bata&aacute;n. In 1684 he became vicar of
that convent, and in 1686 he was appointed rector and chancellor of the
college of Santo Tom&aacute;s in Manila. He left the islands before
July 13, 1689, and from that time until 1696 was in charge of the
hospitium in Mexico. In 1696 he was sent to Spain as definitor in

Binondo; became vicar of S&aacute;mal in the province of Bata&aacute;n
in 1680, and in 1682 of Abucay, after which he was again at Binondo.
During the years 1686&ndash;1690, he was procurator-general, and during
part of that time (1686&ndash;1688), had charge of the natives in the
Manila convent. In 1690 he was definitor and acted as vicar again of
Binondo, where he remained until 1698, when he became president of the
college of San Juan de Letr&aacute;n. He was appointed president of the
hospital of San Gabriel, and procurator-general of the province.
Although assigned as vicar of the convent of San Telmo in Cavite in
1702, he resigned that office in November of that same year, and went
to the mission at Ituy. His death occurred on the nineteenth of the
following month, and resulted from the unhealthful region. During the
year spent among the mountains of Zambales, he formed the village of

college of Santo Tom&aacute;s in Manila, where he remained for four
years. The following eight years were spent in Abucay and Oriong. In
the year 1702 he received the title of calificador of the Holy Office,
and in 1706 was appointed rector and chancellor of the university,
which position he filled until 1710, when he was elected provincial of
the order. On the termination of that office in 1714, he was elected
regent of studies in the college of Santo Tom&aacute;s. In November of
that same year, however, he resigned in order to return to his convent
at Salamanca, arriving in Madrid in 1716. Although lie was elected
prior of the Salamanca convent, he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>[In previous volumes have appeared various accounts of the piratical
raids made, down to 1640, by the Mahometan Malays of Mindanao and other
southern islands against the Spaniards and the native tribes whom they
had subjected in the northern islands. A very brief outline of that
information is here presented, with citations of volumes where it
appears, as a preliminary to some further account which shall summarize
this subject for the remainder of the seventeenth century.]</p>

<p>[When Legazpi first explored the Philippines, he sent some of his
officers to open up trade with Mindanao, then reputed to be rich in
gold and cinnamon (<span class="smallcaps">Vol. II</span>, pp.
116&ndash;118, 147, 154, 209, 210). At the outset, much jealousy arose
among the Spaniards against the Mahometan Malays (whom they called
Moros) of that and other islands in the southern part of the Eastern
archipelago, for two reasons&mdash;the Moros were
&ldquo;infidels,&rdquo; and they far excelled the Spaniards as traders
(<span class="smallcaps">Vol. II</span>, pp. 156, 159, 186, 187; <span
class="smallcaps">IV</span>, pp. 66, 151, 174). Moreover, the natives
were everywhere hostile to the Spaniards because the Portuguese
representing themselves to be Castilians, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb278" href="#pb278">278</a>]</span>had previously made cruel raids on
some of those islands, notably Bohol (<span class="smallcaps">Vol.
II</span>, pp. 117, 184, 207, 208, 229; <span class="smallcaps">
III</span>, p. 46). In that first year, 1565, a Bornean vessel was
captured by the Spaniards, after a desperate fight; but hostilities
then went no further (<span class="smallcaps">Vol. II</span>, pp. 116,
206). The Moros of the Rio Grande of Mindanao proffered (1574) their
submission to the Spanish power, apparently being in some awe of it
(<span class="smallcaps">Vol. III</span>, p. 275). Governor Sande had
expansive ideas of Spanish dominion, and in 1578&ndash;79 undertook an
expedition for the subjugation of Borneo, Mindanao, and Jol&oacute;; he
obtained a temporary success, but the Moros again asserted their
independence as soon as the Spaniards departed (<span class=
"smallcaps">Vol. IV</span>, pp. 125, 130, 148&ndash;303; XV, pp. 54,
132). This expedition was partly caused by piratical raids made by the
Borneans (<span class="smallcaps">Vol. IV</span>, pp. 151, 153, 154,
159; <span class="smallcaps">VI</span>, p. 183), and the Joloans (<span
class="smallcaps">Vol. IV</span>, pp. 176, 236) against the northern
islands. Apparently this punishment intimidated the Moros for a time;
the next important raid by them was in 1595 (<span class=
"smallcaps">Vol. IX</span>, p. 196; <span class="smallcaps">XI</span>,
p. 266). In 1591 Esteban Rodriguez de Figueroa had made a contract with
Gomez P. Dasmari&ntilde;as for the conquest of Mindanao (<span class= 
"smallcaps">Vol. VIII</span>, pp. 73&ndash;77). The island had then
been partly explored and much of it assigned to Spaniards in
repartimiento; some of these allotments are mentioned in <span class= 
"smallcaps">Vol. VIII</span>, pp. 127, 128, 132 (a list of those
bestowed in 1571 is found in the Pastells edition of Colin&rsquo;s <i
lang="es">Labor evang&eacute;lica</i>, i, p. 157, note 1). Instructions
were given to Figueroa on November 13, 1595 (<span class=
"smallcaps">Vol. IX</span>, pp. 181&ndash;188), and in the following
spring he set out with an armed force; but hardly had he begun the
campaign when he was slain by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283"
href="#pb283">283</a>]</span>a Moro (<span class="smallcaps">Vol.
IX</span>, pp. 195, 196, 263&ndash;265, 276, 277; XV, pp. 89&ndash;93;
<span class="smallcaps">XVI</span>, pp. 270&ndash;272). Juan de
Ronquillo succeeded him, and for the time &ldquo;pacified&rdquo; the
hostile Moros (<span class="smallcaps">Vol. IX</span>, pp.
281&ndash;298; <span class="smallcaps">X</span>, pp. 41, 42, 49, 168,
169, 214, 215; <span class="smallcaps">XI</span>, p. 236; <span class= 
"smallcaps">XV</span>, pp. 95&ndash;100; <span class="smallcaps">
XVI</span>, pp. 273, 274); see his own report of the campaign (<span
class="smallcaps">Vol. X</span>, pp. 53&ndash;74) and Tello&rsquo;s
(<span class="smallcaps">Vol. X</span>, pp. 219&ndash;226; cf. <span
class="smallcaps">Vol. XI</span>, pp. 135&ndash;139). In 1599 the
Spanish fort at La Caldera was dismantled (<span class="smallcaps">Vol.
XI</span>, pp. 138, 139, 237; <span class="smallcaps">XV</span>, pp.
190, 191); this emboldened the Moros to renew their piracies, and from
1600 on they harassed the Visayan Islands and even
Luz&oacute;n&mdash;not only the Mindanaos but their allies the
Ternatans, and the Joloans (<span class="smallcaps">Vol. XI</span>, pp.

pp. 31, 200). These attacks kept the peaceful natives in constant fear;
their villages were burned and plundered, and their fields ravaged; and
thousands were carried away to be sold as slaves, being thus dispersed
among the Malay Islands. In 1621 Hernando de los Rios Coronel stated
that ten thousand Christians were held captive in Mindanao (<span
class="smallcaps">Vol. XIX</span>, p. 264). At times the Spaniards sent
armed fleets in pursuit of these pirates, but the latter would escape,
on account of the superior lightness and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb284" href="#pb284">284</a>]</span>swiftness of their vessels.
Punitive expeditions were sent to their villages, some of which were
futile, but others inflicted on them severe punishment&mdash;Jolo: 1602
(<span class="smallcaps">Vol. XV</span>, pp. 240&ndash;243, 264, 265),
1626 (<span class="smallcaps">XXII</span>, pp. 207&ndash;210), 1628

"smallcaps">XXII</span>, pp. 116&ndash;119, 218, 224). It was proposed
to enslave any Moro pirates who might be captured (<span class= 
"smallcaps">Vol. XVII</span>, pp. 187, 296, 331; <span class=
"smallcaps">XXIX</span>, p. 269), and this was sometimes done (<span
class="smallcaps">Vol. XXII</span>, p. 134). Finally, Corcuera
undertook to chastise them effectually; and in 1637 he led a large and
well-equipped expedition to Mindanao, which captured Corralat&rsquo;s
stronghold and devastated nearly all the coast of that island, driving
out Corralat as a fugitive and intimidating other chiefs who had
intrigued with him against the Spaniards (<span class="smallcaps">Vol.
XXVII</span>, pp. 253&ndash;305, 319&ndash;325, 346&ndash;357; <span
class="smallcaps">XXIX</span>, pp. 28&ndash;30, 60, 86&ndash;101,
116&ndash;134). Corcuera followed up this success by another in
Jol&oacute;, in 1638 (<span class="smallcaps">Vol. XXVII</span>, p.
325; <span class="smallcaps">XXVIII</span>, pp. 41&ndash;63; <span
class="smallcaps">XXIX</span>, pp. 32, 36, 43, 44, 135, 136), and in
the following year a Spanish expedition severely chastised the Moros
around Lake Lanao, in Mindanao (<span class="smallcaps">XXIX</span>,
pp. 159, 161&ndash;163, 273&ndash;275); further military operations in

1638&ndash;39 (<span class="smallcaps">Vol. XXIX</span>, pp.
141&ndash;166, 198&ndash;200). It may be noted, further, that the
Jesuits established missions there at an early date, evangelists of

<p>[The second reduction of Jol&oacute;&mdash;by Almonte, in 1639
(<span class="smallcaps">Vol. XXIX</span>, p. 143)&mdash;subdued all of
that archipelago, save the Guimbanos, a fierce Moro people inhabiting
the mountains of Sulu (Jol&oacute;) Island, who were hostile to the
Joloans of the coast. When Almonte ordered them to cease disturbing the
pacified Joloans, the Guimbanos made an insolent reply, telling the
Spaniards to come to their country and learn the difference between
them and the Joloans. Almonte therefore sent (July, 1639) troops, under
Luis de Guzman and Agustin de Cepeda, to subdue these proud
mountaineers; and after a fierce battle the Guimbanos retreated,
leaving four hundred dead on the field, and three hundred captives in
the hands of the Spaniards&mdash;of whom eight died, including Guzman,
besides twenty Indian auxiliaries. (Murillo Velarde, <i lang="es">Hist.
de Philipinas</i>, fol. 96 b, 97.) After the departure of Almonte from
Jol&oacute;, affairs went ill, Morales being unfit for his post as
governor of those islands, although he was valiant in battle. Having
abducted a beautiful girl, daughter of a chief named Salibanza, a
conspiracy against him was formed by the enraged father; this was
discovered, and the leaders seized. This, with several arbitrary and
hostile measures of Morales, stirred up the Joloans to revolt, and an
affray occurred between them and the Spaniards, in which Morales was
wounded. Juan Ruiz Maroto was sent to relieve him from office, and
tried to pacify the natives, but in vain; he then sent Pedro de la Mata
Vergara to harry all the coast of Jol&oacute;, who burned many villages
and carried away three thousand captives. Mata, being obliged to return
to Mindanao, was succeeded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href= 
"#pb286">286</a>]</span>by Morales, who rashly attacked (near
P&aacute;rang, Sulu Island) a force of Moros with troops exhausted by
forced marches; the Spaniards, although in numbers far superior to the
Moros, were ignominiously put to flight, thirty-nine of their number
being slain, including Morales and another officer. At this time Cepeda
was governor of Jol&oacute;, and he soon found it necessary to chastise
the natives, who were encouraged to rebellion by their recent victory.

of his exploits in this direction is furnished by letters of the Jesuit
Miguel Paterio to Father Juan Lopez, regarding the expeditions of
Cepeda (to whom Comb&eacute;s dedicated his book), written in
1643&ndash;44 (<i lang="la">ut supra</i>, col. cix&ndash;cxv); we
present them here as a specimen of the proceedings in these punitive
expeditions.]</p>

<p><i>Relation of the exploit which was accomplished in the villages of
Paran by Captain and Sargento-mayor Don Agustin de Zepeda, warden of
the forts in Jolo.</i></p>

<p>After the disaster to Admiral Morales, the Guimbanos of the villages
of Paran were very arrogant and haughty, so that, however much they
were invited, with assurance of peace and pardon, to lay down their
arms before those of our king, and to restore the Spanish weapons that
they were keeping, they paid no heed to it. Seeing this, Sargento-mayor
Don Augustin de &Ccedil;epeda, the better to justify the expedition
that he intended to make against them, sent word to them through other
Guimbanos who were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href=
"#pb287">287</a>]</span>our friends, that they must restore the arms
that they had taken from the Spaniards, and that if they did not
restore these he would wage war against them. To this they replied that
those arms were converted into lances, and that nothing would be given
up to the Spaniards, whether Don Agustin marched against them or not.
The captain and sargento-mayor received this reply on Tuesday, December
29, and on Wednesday, the thirtieth of the same month, he determined to
make a daylight attack on them with the utmost secrecy. Accordingly, at
four in the afternoon, almost all the soldiers made their confessions,
and the sargento-mayor exhorted them to rouse all their courage, as
brave soldiers, since they were fighting for both the majesties
[<i>i.e.</i>, the divine and the royal], and they had the sure
protection of the mother of God, our Lady of Good Success. Then they
set out from the hill of Jolo with only twenty-five Spaniards and three
officers, [Cepeda&rsquo;s lieutenants being] Adjutant Diego de los
Reyes and Alf&eacute;rez Gaspar de Chaves; and twenty-two Pampangos and
Cagaians, with their officers, also ten or fifteen servants with their
pikes and shields. Of this infantry the captain formed three divisions,
giving to each one its own watchword&mdash;to the first one,
&ldquo;Jesus be with all;&rdquo; to the second, &ldquo;Our Lady of Good
Success;&rdquo; to the third, &ldquo;Saint Ignatius&rdquo;&mdash;and
each division was ordered to render aid according to its watchword, and
as the enemy should sound the call to arms. With this order, they began
their march, and proceeded until nightfall, when they marched in single
file, since the road and the darkness gave no opportunity for doing
otherwise. They passed rivers, ravines, marshes, and miry places, until
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288">288</a>]</span>they
arrived at a village of a Guimbano chief named Ulisten, near which they
heard coughing in the houses; and [they moved] so cautiously that they
were not perceived. The sargento-mayor did not choose to enter this
village, not only because the chief had showed his friendship for the
Spaniards, but because his only intention was to punish the people of
Paran, who had merited this by their acts in the past and by the
haughty spirit that they showed. For the same reason, he would not
enter another village near this one, belonging to another chief, named
Sambali&mdash;who, if it were not for the purpose that the commander
had in mind, deserved to lose his head for his rebellious disposition
in not being friendly to the Spaniards. From the hill to these two
villages may be a journey of about two leguas and a half; the road is
very bad, and of the sort that has been described, [passing through]
marshes and rough places; and, with the darkness of a moonlight night,
to go among trees, thickets, and tangled briers was intolerable and
full of difficulty. Not less wearisome was the road which they still
must take to reach the people and village of Paran, and even more
difficult: but neither the one nor the other could weaken or diminish
the tenacity, spirit, and valor which not only the captain but his
soldiers displayed. They traveled all night in this way until a little
before daybreak, when they mistook the road, and took another, which
did not lead to the village where they meant to go; but God chose that
the people of that very village should serve as guides [to the
Spaniards], by furnishing them light&mdash;for on account of quieting
some infants who were crying, they kindled lights in the houses. The
sargento-mayor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href=
"#pb289">289</a>]</span>ordered them to march toward that place, where
they arrived at daybreak; and there they remained about half an hour,
waiting for the dawn to brighten so that they might break the
countersign<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2722src" href="#xd0e2722">1</a>
and make the daylight attack [<i>dar el albasso</i>] on the said
village, which they did. For when it became light, and the day was
brightening, they broke the watchword, which was &ldquo;St.
Ignatius;&rdquo; and the division to which that belonged made the first
attack on the houses, jointly with the vanguard, which went ahead to
reconnoiter. All the forces united to make this assault on the houses,
and to break through the defenses of the village and enter, all in
order, with lighted matches and to sound of drums, as they did. In
their houses this occasioned a great tumult; some were slain by
musket-balls, some by lance-thrusts; others escaped naked, fleeing
without thought of their kindred or their possessions, abandoning their
weapons and whatever they had; others, finally, were burned to death in
their houses, to which our men set fire&mdash;the natives remaining in
them either through fear, or that they might not fall into our hands
and be slain by our lances. They hid themselves, therefore, for the
greater protection&mdash;only to have their houses, and their granaries
of rice, and their bodies burned [here], and finally their souls in
hell. Besides this, their cultivated fields were laid waste, set out
with all the plants that they rear&mdash;bananas, sugar-cane, and other
plants which furnish them with food; and our men did the <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290">290</a>]</span>same with these,
destroying and burning everything. This done they looked about,
scanning the country in all directions, and saw an impregnable height;
and when the commander understood that this was (as it proved to be)
the citadel of the enemies, he gave the order to march thither. They
proceeded by a path or trail so narrow that they were obliged to ascend
in single file; and when they reached the top of the said hill they
found a plateau, more spacious than that of our hill of Jolo, on which
were houses, some fortified and some small ones. The former were full
of provisions and contained some Guimbanos. These, seeing our men and
recognizing them as enemies, immediately abandoned the houses and took
to flight, throwing themselves headlong from the heights. Our men
entered the place, and burned the houses with the rice and other things
contained in them; and they laid waste the fields and destroyed what
had been planted in them, as they had done in the villages before
ascending the hill. Our men were occasioned no little anxiety by their
failure, after this exploit, to find the road by which to leave the
hill; for, as it had in every direction precipices and rugged heights,
they had great difficulty and hardship in getting away from the hill,
on account of not being able to strike the path by which they had
entered. But finally the Blessed Virgin who hitherto had been our Lady
of Success, chose to show also that she was our Lady of Good
Success&mdash;which she did by enabling our men to depart in safety
from the hill. For the alf&eacute;rez, going to make a hasty
reconnoissance with four arquebusiers, and some servants armed with
pikes and shields, saw [traces of men&rsquo;s] work among <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291">291</a>]</span>the trees that
covered the hill; and, upon reaching the place, ascertained that there
was a path by which he could descend. Notifying the troops of this,
they went down the hill by this path, and thus returned to the houses
that they had burned, all marching in regular order. They approached
the seashore through a level field, passing near the harbor where the
natives had slain Admiral Morales; and, as they advanced through the
open country, they encountered four Guimbano Indians, shouting [or
grimacing?&mdash;<i lang="es">haciendo carracheo</i>], who came from a
grove that was growing on the said seashore. When our men tried to get
near them, these Indians took to their heels, retreating toward the
grove&mdash;where, it was understood, they had an ambuscade; and as it
was now eleven o&rsquo;clock, the sargento-mayor did not think it best
to delay [his return] longer. Accordingly, they marched in the same
order, and to the sound of drums, toward the fortification that stood
on the seashore, going through fields and mangrove thickets, and along
beaches and pools of water, another two leguas and a half, until they
reached the harbor where they had provided some boats. In these the
sargento-mayor and all his troops embarked, and returned to these
forts, with great satisfaction and rejoicing at so complete a success,
without losing one of our men, or encountering any danger. Many salvos
were fired from the boats in which they came, and from the forts, in
honor of their protectors, Jesus, Mary, and Ignatius.</p>

<p>From this expedition and victory I have learned some things about
Guimba which are worth mentioning here. The first is, that two days
afterward <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href=
"#pb292">292</a>]</span>the people of Paran made war on the chiefs Ulis
and Sambali whom we mentioned above, complaining that these chiefs had
not warned them that the Spanish troops had passed close to their
villages, and even because they had allowed the Spaniards to pass them.
May God establish them in peace, and grant them light and a knowledge
of the truth. And after this expedition, as I have said, one of the
chiefs in the villages to the east named Suil, complained that the
sargento-mayor had not informed him of it, so that Suil with all his
men might have accompanied the Spaniards. Although he may not be
sincere, thanks are returned to him, and probably his offer was
prompted by the admiration and high opinion that he entertains for our
men since this exploit; or because he feared lest the like fate might
befall him. He and other chiefs beyond Guimba to the east have sent to
tell me that, although those who killed the sargento-mayor are their
brothers, they will not for that reason fail to be the friends of the
Spaniards; and that they will come to the village of the Lutaos who are
in this fort [<i>i.e.</i>, at Jol&oacute;] to talk with the father and
treat of peace. And it cannot be denied that there has been a great
disturbance among them since this expedition, and it has caused among
them all not only fear, but astonishment also, to see that so few
Spaniards could dare to traverse almost all of Guimba, marching almost
all the way among the settlements, without being seen. In this affair
not only the caution of the Spaniards, but their courage in penetrating
among so many barbarians, the most valiant in all these islands, is
causing great admiration&mdash;which is increased at seeing how so few
Spaniards made so great a number of enemies take to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293">293</a>]</span>flight; for in
all the villages there are nearly a thousand barbarians who carry arms.
It is certain that, considering the circumstances of this exploit, it
adds prestige to several others that have been performed; and I even
venture to say that it is astonishing, if we consider what occurred in
one night, the perils that they went through, the daring of so few
soldiers among so many enemies, and, finally, their accomplishing what
they did in destroying and burning the villages and their people,
without injury to any one of our men. All this causes the Moros who see
these occurrences close to them to wonder and fear, and apparently they
are talking in earnest of becoming friends and vassals of his Majesty.
[<i>Marginal note</i>: &ldquo;For Father Juan Lopez, rector of
Cavite.&rdquo;]</p>

<hr class="tb">
<p>[Another letter by Father Paterio, written from Jolo, February 28,
1644, relates the particulars of another expedition by Zepeda into
Guimba, six days previous to that date. The native chiefs on the east
side of the island are intimidated by the punishment inflicted on
Paran, and are inclined to submit to the victorious Spanish arms; but
those on the west desire to take revenge for the massacre of their
tribesmen. A conference of the latter chiefs is accordingly held at the
village of Ulis, where they talk of making an attack on the Spanish
forts at Jolo. They invite Suil, one of the friendly chiefs, to join
them; but he sends word to the Spaniards (February 9) of the plot
against them. Zepeda is then absent in Zamboanga, but returns soon
afterward; and another warning from Suil being received ten days later,
Zepeda decides to inflict summary punishment <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb294" href="#pb294">294</a>]</span>on the plotters. He therefore
leads an expedition against the village of Ulis, on February 21, and,
as before, attacks the village at daylight. This time, the natives have
had warning of the intended assault, and attempt resistance; but they
are defeated with considerable loss&mdash;among the slain being Ulis,
&ldquo;who was the idol of that island, and whom all obeyed,&rdquo; and
three other chiefs. In this fight the Spaniards lose but four
lives&mdash;a soldier, an officer, and two servants. This causes even
more fear and awe than even the former expedition, and brings the
recalcitrants quickly to terms&mdash;Suil and other chiefs proposing to
leave their homes and go to dwell near the Spanish forts. Later, the
Spaniards complete this castigation by ravaging the country, burning
and destroying all before them, &ldquo;by which the Spanish arms have
acquired greater reputation and glory than that which they had lost on
former adverse occasions.&rdquo; Then other islands adjacent to Jolo
are intimidated, and two battles are fought with their natives, who
lose many men therein. As a reward for his services, Zepeda is honored
by Corcuera with the governorship of Zamboanga.]</p>

<hr class="tb">
<p>The Joloans remained at peace, as thoroughly chastised as were the
Mindanaos, curbing their haughty arrogance, and repressing their hatred
in consideration of the advantages of the time. Among the agreements
for the peace, they accepted one that a fort for the Spaniards should
be erected at their harbor-bar; this was maintained with many
difficulties and little advantage, unless from the pearl-fishery, which
yielded many and valuable pearls.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2766src"
href="#xd0e2766">2</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href=
"#pb295">295</a>]</span>The island of Jol&oacute; abounds in these, so
that on the Dutch hydrographical maps they have given it the name
&ldquo;Island of Pearls,&rdquo; on account of the many fine pearls
which the Joloans sent in those years to Nueva Batavia by ambassadors
from their king, asking their alliance, and aid against the Spaniards.
The Dutch granted them protection, those valuable gifts arousing in
them greater desires for profit&mdash;although afterward the first aid
that they furnished the Joloans cost them very dear. But in this year
of 1641 the Joloans had a fortunate opportunity for recouping
themselves for past expenses, with a mass of amber<a class="noteref"
id="xd0e2776src" href="#xd0e2776">3</a> as large as an ox&rsquo;s body,
which the sea cast up on their shores, which yielded them great
profits, and increased the reputation of their island. This sort of
find is usually very frequent in those islands, since they are beaten
by many currents which flow from the archipelago; and thus goes
drifting on the waves what the sea hurls from its abysses, along with
other debris, under the fury of the wind&mdash;this so precious
substance, whether it be the excrement or vomit of whales, or a reaba
which the sea produces in its depths. But in Jol&oacute; it is apt to
be more often found, because those islands are scattered and their
coasts prolonged for many leguas opposite many currents and
channel-mouths. And for this reason <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb296" href="#pb296">296</a>]</span>some amber is usually found in
Capul, an island beaten by so many currents&mdash;as the ships which
come on the return from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a know by
experience&mdash;and also in Guiguan and on the beaches of Antique.
Near Punta de Naso the sea cast up, in the year 1650, an enormous piece
of amber, although it had not the fine quality and excellence of that
which comes from Jap&oacute;n. (Diaz&rsquo;s <i lang="es">
Conquistas</i>, p. 447.)</p>

<p>[For several years after Corcuera&rsquo;s expedition against the
Mindanaos (1637), various military operations were conducted in that
island by the Spanish forces, notably under Pedro de Almonte. Corralat
and other Moro chiefs were sufficiently reduced to render them
nominally peaceful; but they formed various plots and conspiracies
against the Spaniards, and, on the other hand, these availed themselves
of the jealousies and personal interests of the Mindanao chiefs to
separate them and neutralize their efforts. The foolish arrogance of a
Spanish officer, Mat&iacute;as de Marmolejo, caused an attack on his
detachment by Corralat and Manaquior; all the Spaniards save Marmolejo
and six others were slain (June 1, 1642), including the Jesuit
Bartolom&eacute; S&aacute;nchez, and the survivors were captured by
Corralat. But when Corcuera heard of this encounter he was so angry
that he ordered Marmolejo to be ransomed and afterwards to be beheaded
in the plaza at Zamboanga, for disobedience to his orders. He also
ordered that the fort at La Sabanilla be demolished, and the men there
be sent to punish Corralat, which was done. That chief, to revenge
himself, intrigued with the people of Basilan to secure possession of
the Spanish fort there; but its little garrison defended it against the
Moro fleet until aid could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href= 
"#pb297">297</a>]</span>be sent them from Zamboanga. As soon as Diego
Fajardo became governor of the Philippines in Corcuera&rsquo;s place,
he endeavored to secure peace in Mindanao, and finally (June 24, 1645)
a treaty of peace was signed by Corralat and his leading chiefs, and
Francisco de Atienza and the Jesuit Alejandro L&oacute;pez. This treaty
settled questions of mutual alliance, of boundaries of possessions, of
trade, of ransom of captives, and of freedom for the ministrations of
Jesuit missionaries. Christian captives in Corralat&rsquo;s domain
should be ransomed at the following rates; &ldquo;for men and women, in
the prime of life, and in good health, each forty pesos; for those who
were more youthful, thirty pesos; for aged and sick persons, twenty
pesos; for children at the breast, ten pesos.&rdquo; In this very year
Salicala, son of the king of Jol&oacute;, had gone to Batavia to seek
aid from the Dutch; the latter sent some armed vessels, which
cannonaded the Spanish fort at Jol&oacute; for three days, but finally
were obliged to depart without having accomplished anything. This
occurrence increased Fajardo&rsquo;s anxiety in regard to the cost and
danger incurred in attempting to maintain three forts in Jol&oacute;;
and he sent orders to Atienza, commandant at Zamboanga, to withdraw the
garrisons from Jol&oacute; and demolish those forts&mdash;an
embarrassing command, since both Joloans and Dutch were then making
raids among the northern islands. Both Fajardo and Atienza relied on
the Jesuit Alejandro Lopez to bring about the pacification of both the
Mindanaos and the Joloans, a task which he accomplished so successfully
that on April 14, 1646, a treaty was signed, by Atienza and Lopez,<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e2797src" href="#xd0e2797">4</a> with <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298">298</a>]</span>Raya Bongso
of Jol&oacute; (the same who, with his wife Tuambaloca, was conquered
by Corcuera&rsquo;s troops in 1638) and the envoys of Corralat.
Comb&eacute;s gives the full text of both this and the former treaty. A
Dutch fleet attempted to make a landing near Zamboanga, but were
repulsed by the Spaniards with much loss. Corralat and Moncay came to
hostilities, and the former implored the aid of the Spaniards; Atienza
sent an armed force to succor Corralat, and Moncay fled. Salicala of
Jol&oacute; and Panguian Cachilo of Guimba undertook (1648) to raid the
Visayan Islands; but the latter was attacked and slain by a Spanish
squadron, which so intimidated Salicala that he hastened back to
Jol&oacute;. Meanwhile, a notable event occurred in Mindanao, the
conversion of Corralat&rsquo;s military commander, Ugbu, to the
Christian faith&mdash;which of course tended to strengthen the ties
between Corralat and the Spaniards; and Ugbu afterward rendered them
efficient service in the Palapag insurrection, which caused his death.
Salicala died (1649) and his parents, Bongso and Tuambaloca, were thus
able to maintain the peace which they had established with the
Spaniards; that queen afterward left Jol&oacute;, retiring to Basilan.
Moncay also died, soon afterward, and was succeeded in Buhayen by
Balatamay, a Manobo chief who had married Moncay&rsquo;s daughter; he
joined Corralat in alliance with the Spaniards. In January, 1649, Pedro
Duran de Monforte went with an armed fleet to northeastern Borneo, to
punish its people for aiding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href= 
"#pb299">299</a>]</span>the Joloans in their raids; the Spaniards
plundered several villages, burned three hundred caracoas, and carried
away two hundred captives. The expedition was accompanied by Jesuits,
who afterward opened successful missions in Borneo. The insurrection of
1649&ndash;50 spread to Jol&oacute; and Mindanao, but was quelled by
the Spaniards (see <span class="smallcaps">Vol. XXXVIII</span>).

<hr class="tb">
<p>[In 1653 Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara succeeded to the government
of the Philippines.] One of his first undertakings was to establish
peace with the ruler of Mindanao, Cachil Corralat, whom it was
expedient to assure for the sake of the tranquillity of the Pintados
Islands&mdash;which were more exposed than the others to the incursions
of their armed fleets, since Manila had not enough soldiers and vessels
with which our people could go forth to hinder the operations of the
Moros. The governor sent as his ambassador Captain Don Diego de Lemus,
and Father Francisco Lado of the Society of Jesus, who were very kindly
received by the Moros; and he gave them to understand that no one
desired peace more than he did, since the warning was still fresh that
had been given him by the war which was waged against him by Governor
Don Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera in person&mdash;which had obliged
Corralat to wander as a fugitive through the lands of his enemy the
king of Buhayen, exposed to many perils. It seems as if the desire
which Corralat showed to maintain the peace might be regarded as <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300">300</a>]</span>sincere;
for if he had chosen to avail himself of the opportunity afforded by
the past years, when all our forces and power were fully occupied in
resisting the cruel invasions of the Dutch, without doubt he could have
made great ravages in the villages of the Pintados Islands; and
therefore this must be attributed to an especial providence of the
divine mercy. All [these dealings with the envoys] were cunning
measures of the shrewd Moro to lull<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2830src"
href="#xd0e2830">5</a> our vigilance with feigned appearances of peace,
for never was he further from pursuing it&mdash;partly through greed
for the booty of slaves, a great part of which belonged to him; partly
because his captains and other persons interested in these piratical
raids persuaded him to avail himself of the opportunity furnished by
the weakness of our forces. Corralat determined to renew his former
hostile acts, and began by preparing vessels and supplies; and in order
to cover up better his damnable intention, he sent to the governor of
Manila an ambassador to confirm the peace. This man was called Banua,
and was no less fraudulent than Simon the Greek. On the route he left
many tokens of this; for in the village of Tunganan, among the Subanos,
he treated very contemptuously<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2836src" href= 
"#xd0e2836">6</a> the father minister, Miguel Pareja of the Society of
Jesus&mdash;who, as the pious religious that he was, turned the other
cheek, as the gospel commands. Banua arrived at Manila in the year of
1655, where he discharged very well his office as ambassador, and even
better that of spy&mdash;and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href= 
"#pb301">301</a>]</span>well he knew his double trade; for among other
things he demanded that restitution be made to Corralat of some
Mindanao slaves, and of the pieces of artillery which Don Sebastian
Hurtado de Corcuera had taken from him in war; but this and other
petitions of the ambassador had no satisfactory issue. Banua returned
[to Mindanao], and Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara despatched to
accompany him Captain Don Claudio de Rivera, and Father Alejandro Lopez
of the Society of Jesus, who went with holy zeal for establishing in
Mindanao the preaching of the true faith. They arrived at Zamboanga,
where they had sufficient warnings of the danger to which they were
going; but with fearless courage they continued their journey until
they reached Corralat. He received them without any of the ostentation
usual for an embassy, but rather with frowns and displeasure; and when
he read the letters from the governor of Manila&mdash;which were
excellent for an occasion in which our strength might be greater, but
the present time demanded shrewder dissimulation&mdash;the Moro king
was much disturbed, and displayed extreme anger. The end of this
embassy (of which an excellent account is given by Father Francisco
Comb&eacute;s in his <i lang="es">Historia de Mindanao</i>, book viii,
chap. 3) was that Corralat ordered his nephew Balatamay to slay Father
Alejandro Lopez and his associate, Father Juan de Montiel, and Captain
Claudio de Rivera.<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2847src" href=
"#xd0e2847">7</a> Corralat sent the letters of the governor to the
kings of Jol&oacute; and of Ternate, to incite them to make common
cause in defense of their profession as Mahometans, but they did not
choose to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href=
"#pb302">302</a>]</span>risk breaking the peace; on the contrary, the
king of Ternate handed over the letters to the governor of our forts
there, Francisco de Esteybar, who restored them to the governor of
Manila. (Diaz, <i lang="es">Conquistas</i>, pp. 549&ndash;551.)</p>

<p>Corralat, fearing the vengeance of the Spaniards, wrote to the
governor of Zamboanga throwing the responsibility for what had occurred
on his nephew Balatamay, whom he could not chastise on account of the
latter being so powerful. He also wrote to Manrique de Lara,
attributing the deaths of the Jesuits and other Spaniards to imprudent
acts committed by Father L&oacute;pez, and entreated the governor that,
mutually forgiving injuries, affairs might remain as they had
previously been. But his complicity in the event came to be discovered,
through another letter directed in June, 1656, to the sultan of
Jol&oacute;, exhorting the latter to unite with him for defending the
religion which both professed. The Joloan monarch sent his letter to
the governor of Zamboanga in order to demonstrate his loyalty. Similar
assistance was solicited by Corralat from the Dutch and from the
sovereigns of Macasar and Ternate; and to the latter, in order to
stimulate him more, he sent the original letter of Manrique de Lara,
presenting the question under the religious aspect only&mdash;a letter
which the Spanish governor of Ternate was able to recover, and he sent
it to its author. The captain-general of Filipinas, not considering his
forces sufficient for waging war on the powerful sultan of Mindanao,
notified the governor of Zamboanga<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2857src"
href="#xd0e2857">8</a> to accept Corralat&rsquo;s excuses as sufficient
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303">303</a>]</span>until
he could ascertain whether re&euml;nforcements were arriving from Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a and they could avenge so many injuries.</p>

<p>The sultan, seeing that his insolent conduct did not receive the
energetic and effectual punishment that it deserved, gained new
courage, and sent out his people to make raids through the coasts of
Zamboanga and Basilan&mdash;terminating the campaign by looting
Tanganan, where they took captive the headman of that village, named
Ampi, and twenty-three persons besides. In the Calamianes Islands also
the Mindanaos committed horrible ravages. The governor of the Moluccas,
Don Francisco de Esteybar, received orders to go to Zamboanga,
conferring upon him, besides the command of the said post, the office
of governor and captain-general of all the southern provinces of
Filipinas. On the second of December of the said year 1656 he arrived
at Zamboanga. When this valiant chief was informed of what had
occurred, and learned that the pirates were equipping at Simuay [River]
a squadron to invade the Visayas, he declared war on Corralat, without
stopping to consider whether his forces were inferior or not to those
of the enemy, trusting to the courage of his followers and the justice
of his cause for the issue of the undertaking. In this document he
ordered that ten caracoas should set out, under command of Don Fernando
de Bobadilla; and these vessels went to sea on December 30. This
commander detached Admiral Don Pedro de Viruega at the village of
Sosocon, and Sargento-mayor Don F&eacute;lix de Herrera at Point
Taguima. Through his spies, Corralat knew of the departure of the
squadron, and declined to send his boats against the Spanish armada;
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href=
"#pb304">304</a>]</span>during twenty days Bobadilla waited in vain for
the pirate vessels. During this time the dato of Sibuguey, Mintun, went
to Zamboanga, offering the aid of his people against Corralat, perhaps
in order not to be the leader in paying for the losses of the war. It
was reported that the sultan had sent four vessels to the village of
that chief for rice, and Bobadilla set out to intercept this convoy
(January 2, 1657). On arriving at La Silanga,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e2866src" href="#xd0e2866">9</a> two small caracoas went ahead to
reconnoiter the place; these boats conquered a large vessel; but their
crews intimidated the Lutaos who were in the Spanish ship, telling them
that they would soon be destroyed by Corralat, who was expected in
Mintun with fifteen vessels. As the Lutaos of Bobadilla&rsquo;s
squadron were inclined toward the sultan, or were afraid of falling
into his power, they threatened the commandant that they would abandon
the field when the battle was at its height, if the Spaniards compelled
them to fight against Corralat. In view of this, Bobadilla was obliged
to return to Zamboanga, losing so propitious an opportunity to avenge
the wicked perfidy of the old sultan. Nevertheless, he seized a
considerable number of small boats, full of rice, and forty captives.
The sultan, now a declared enemy, and attributing to our weakness the
failure to punish the murder of the ambassadors, commanded his
squadrons to commit piracies, under the command of Prince Balatamay.
That deceitful Moro, after committing the most outrageous acts of
violence in Marinduque and Mindoro, returned to Mindanao with a
multitude of captives and very rich spoils. <span class="pagenum">[<a
id="pb305" href="#pb305">305</a>]</span></p>

<p>While Balatamay was raiding the above-mentioned islands, a splendid
squadron sailed from Cavite by order of the governor-general, in
command of an officer whose name is not told in the histories, from
whom brilliant conduct was expected, to judge from the valor of which
he boasted in drawing-rooms; but, far from fulfilling his duty, he
lingered in Balayan under pretext of securing supplies of rice, and
then in Mindoro, carrying out his cowardly purpose of not encountering
the Moros, notwithstanding that the forces under his command were more
than sufficient to destroy the pirates. To the end that he might
operate in conjunction with the said squadron, Esteybar ordered
Alf&eacute;rez Luis de Vargas to scour the coasts of Mindanao; but as
the commander of the squadron failed to carry out the instructions that
he had received, Vargas, as he could not find him, confined his efforts
to burning a village on the bay of Simuay, where he seized several
captives. Bobadilla reduced to ashes the old capital of Corralat,
Lamitan, its inhabitants having fled to the woods. Also in the said
year of 1657 the dato Salicala of Mindanao scoured the seas with his
squadron; the natives in consternation abandoned their villages without
daring to resist him, and he carried away as captives more than a
thousand Indians&mdash;his audacity going so far that he sailed into
the bay of Manila.</p>

<p>Esteybar then equipped a small squadron of caracoas and vintas,
which departed from Zamboanga on January 1, 1658, resolved to chastise
the pirate severely. He spread the report that they were going to
Sibuguey. He reached that river in seven days and, placing part of his
forces in charge of Sargento-mayor Itamarren, he destroyed the village
of Namucan, and at Luraya burned many boats. Four pilans <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306">306</a>]</span>captured the
joanga which had carried Father L&oacute;pez to Simuay, manned by Moros
from Mintun. Suddenly changing his course, he took the route to Punta
de Flechas, in order to go to the capital of Corralat, but sent
beforehand thirty Spaniards, with Captain Don Pedro de Viruega, to the
district of Butig. Its chief Matundin, at the head of five hundred men,
was defeated, the grain-fields ravaged, and the village reduced to
ashes. The tilled land of this district was exceedingly rich, since it
is the principal source of supply for rice in Mindanao. Great damage
was also done in La Sabanilla by Captain Don Juan Gonz&aacute;lez
Carlete. On the nineteenth of January the squadron encountered a large
Dutch ship surrounded by some pirate vessels. Esteybar attempted to
secure a free passage without bringing on a contest, to which end he
hoisted a white flag; but the commander of the Dutch ship displayed a
red flag, firing all his cannon against the Spanish vessels. Then,
without heeding the superiority of the enemy, Bobadilla came against
the ship, all his men rowing as hard as they could; and Esteybar
attacked it at the stern. The Spaniards then were going to board the
ship with a rush, when a ball fired from the vessel of Esteybar set on
fire the Santa Barbara [i.e., powder-magazine] of the Dutch ship, thus
blowing it into pieces. Only twenty-four of its crew survived, and
these were drawn out of the sea and made prisoners. Esteybar continued
his voyage to Simuay, the bar of which was fortified with heavy
stockades; moreover, at its ends were two forts, garrisoned by Malays,
Macassars, and Dutchmen. This did not frighten Esteybar, and he made
preparations to capture the posts of the enemy, in spite of advice
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307">307</a>]</span>to
the contrary from his captains. While he was deciding the best method
of accomplishing this, he passed with his squadron to the river of
Buhayen, sending in by one of its entrances the valiant Bobadilla with
some vessels, and by the other Sargento-mayor Itamarren. The former
sacked the villages and ravaged the grain-fields of Tannil and Tabiran,
the latter those of Lumapuc and Buhayen; they destroyed a powerful
armada which had been prepared for raiding the islands, and carried
away as spoil many versos, muskets, campilans, crises, and all kinds of
weapons.</p>

<p>In the village of Buhayen resided Prince Hamo, son of Moncay, from
whom the kingdom had been usurped; he mounted a white flag and a cross
above his house, being desirous of forming an alliance with the
Spaniards, but they, being warned by experience with the treasons of
the Moros, continued the hostilities, without attaching any importance
to that signal. While they constructed rafts with which to attack the
fortress of Corralat, Captain Antonio de Palacios went to destroy the
village of Tampacan and its environs; and Adjutant Antonio
V&aacute;zquez disembarked with orders to cut off the retreat of the
enemy&rsquo;s spies. These were twenty in number, thoroughly armed;
V&aacute;zquez rushed upon them, and at the first encounter killed five
and wounded six of them, and the rest were shot to death in the woods.
Esteybar returned to the bar of Buhayen; he knew that at a day&rsquo;s
journey from there was a village of Lutaos, called Maolo, and, desirous
to chastise that settlement and obtain information about that coast, he
sent Sargento-mayor Itamarren&mdash;who, finding it deserted, set fire
to the village, killed four Moros, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308"
href="#pb308">308</a>]</span>and captured two others, the only ones who
waited for the attack.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these provocations, and others that were directly
offered to Corralat in the environs of his fortifications, it was
impossible to draw him out into the open country. Having constructed a
number of rafts, on which were placed pieces of artillery, the governor
went aboard the largest of them, and with the aid of the vessels
cannonaded the fort of Corralat for the space of four hours, but he
defended it well. It was evident that the difficulties of assaulting it
were insuperable, and that the artillery was operating with but little
result, on account of the condition of the sea; accordingly it was
decided to retire to the bar of Buhayen. The squadron went to La
Sabanilla on the seventeenth of February; here Esteybar received orders
to return to Molucas, and he proceeded to Zamboanga. Notwithstanding
the well-known valor of this chief, and the injuries inflicted on the
Moros during the two months of the campaign, this retreat gave much
satisfaction to Corralat, since it freed him from [the danger of] going
as a wanderer through the hills, as on previous occasions.</p>

<p>The valiant Esteybar had been replaced as governor of the military
post of Zamboanga by Don Fernando de Bobadilla&mdash;a chief no less
courageous and resolute&mdash;with the same titles and preeminences as
the former. Corralat, in order better to secure his dominions against
the aggressions of the Spaniards, made Namu, king of Buhayen, establish
a fort at the mouth of the river, the opposite shore of which was
likewise fortified by Corralat; he entrusted to Marundin the defense of
the bar of Simuay, and to the Basilan chiefs Ondol and Boto the
construction of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href=
"#pb309">309</a>]</span>fortification at the entrance of the estuary of
Zamboanga. Don Diego Zarria Lazcano took the place of Bobadilla, the
former remaining at the head of the armada.</p>

<p>The datos Linao and Libot of Jol&oacute;, and Sacahati of Tawi-Tawi,
with thirteen vessels, scoured the coasts of Bohol, Leyte, and Masbate.
Near Luban they put to death father Fray Antonio de San Agustin, who on
account of his ailments could not retreat to the interior of that
island as did the rest who were going with him in their vessel. A
squadron sailed from Manila in command of Don Pedro Duran de Monforte;
they went to Luban, Mindoro, Panay, and Gigantes without discovering
the pirates, and returned to the capital. The Moros were able to return
to Jol&oacute; with many spoils and eighty captives; but the sultan of
that island sent back the said captives, in order to prove that he
desired peace with the Spaniards. (Montero y Vidal. <i lang="es">Hist.
pirater&iacute;a</i>, i, pp. 236&ndash;244. Cf. Comb&eacute;s, <i lang= 
"es">Hist. Mindanao</i>, col. 533&ndash;549, 570&ndash;587.)</p>

<hr class="tb">
<p>Great were the calamities suffered by the Filipinas Islands in these
years of 1657 and 58, which might have occasioned their entire ruin, if
divine Providence had not manifestly preserved them, at the expense of
miracles and prodigies. Even the arrogance of the Dutch recognized
this, when they saw their proud forces humiliated by the unequal
strength of ours; and it was acknowledged by the inhabitants of these
islands, recognizing the divine clemency. In the former of those years
the scourge of divine justice was the great armada of Mindanao
corsairs, which, commanded by Salicala, a Moro of much valor, infested
the Pintados Islands; and their insolence went <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310">310</a>]</span>so far that they came in
sight of the great bay of Manila. The poor natives who groaned under
the yoke of captivity to these pirates amounted to more than a
thousand; and as it was impossible for most of them to furnish ransom
for their persons, they usually died as slaves of the Moros. I have not
been able to learn the reason why no assistance was given to deliver
them by going out to find those pirates&mdash;although I do not believe
that it was the absence of compassion in Governor Don Sabiniano
Manrique de Lara, but rather his lack of means, and his being engrossed
with more pressing affairs. This was followed by the plagues of
innumerable locusts, which, laying waste the fields, made general
havoc, occasioning the famine which was the worst enemy of the poor;
this was followed by its inseparable companion, pestilence, which made
great ravages with a general epidemic of smallpox. (Diaz, <i lang="es">
Conquistas</i>, p. 556.)</p>

<p>General Don Agustin de Cepeda went to Zamboanga as governor (June
16, 1659), without any events worthy of mention occurring during the
time while he exercised that office; afterward he went to assume the
government of Molucas. He who took his place<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e2910src" href="#xd0e2910">10</a> experienced great annoyances with
the Jesuits, who in their histories relate in great detail how much he
tried to injure their interests; but Don Fernando Bobadilla was again
charged with the government of Zamboanga (February 15, 1662).</p>

<p>The authorities and citizens of Manila were the victims in May,
1662, of a fearful panic, on account of the claim by the powerful
Chinese pirate Kue-Sing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href= 
"#pb311">311</a>]</span>that the little realm of Filipinas should
render him homage and be declared his tributary, under penalty of his
going with his squadrons to destroy the Spaniards&mdash;as he had done
with the Dutch, expelling them from Formosa. This embassy, which was
brought to Manila by the Dominican father Fray Victorio Ricci, and the
consequent indignation against the Chinese, were the origin of an
insurrection by those who resided in Manila, which was subdued; and the
conference of authorities resolved to expel them from the country and
repel by force of arms the aggression of Kue-Sing&mdash;the
governor-general making ready great armaments, and whatever
preparations for defense seemed to him necessary that he might come out
victorious from the tremendous danger that threatened the island.</p>

<p>But the most important and most far-reaching of the measures adopted
by the council at which Manrique de Lara presided was the abandonment
of the advantageous post of Zamboanga&mdash;the advanced sentinel of
our domination over the coasts inhabited by the fierce Malay
Mahometans&mdash;and those of La Sabanilla, Calamianes, and Iligan
(which were also important in the highest degree), with the intention
of concentrating in Manila all the forces which garrisoned those posts
(May 6). This notification caused, among the Spanish subjects of those
lands, or it may be among the Lutaos, profound sorrow and the utmost
fear. They complained bitterly of the unprotected state in which they
were left, remaining exposed to the vengeance of the Moros&mdash;who no
longer could consider them as belonging to their race, and bore a
mortal hatred to them for having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312"
href="#pb312">312</a>]</span>become Christians.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd0e2924src" href="#xd0e2924">11</a> These just complaints, and the
knowledge of the damages which would result from the withdrawal of the
Spanish forces, impelled the governor of the fort, Don Fernando
Bobadilla, and the learned Father Comb&eacute;s to entreat the
governor-general to revoke his mandate, both explaining to him the very
cogent and strong reasons which prompted their advice. The news that
the Spaniards were involved in so tremendous a conflict encouraged
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313">313</a>]</span>the
Joloans to repeat once more their terrible incursions. The datos of
Jol&oacute;, Tawi-Tawi, Lacay-Lacay, and Tuptup, equipped sixty
vessels, and, dividing their forces into several small squadrons,
sacked and burned the villages of Poro, Baybay, Sogor, Cabalian, Basey,
Dangajon, Guinobatan, and Capul. They killed Captain Gabriel de la
Pe&ntilde;a; they captured an official of the same class, Ignacio de la
Cueva, and the Jesuit father Buenaventura Barcena; they went even to
the mountains in pursuit of the religious; and all the Indians whom
they caught they carried away as captives to their own country, killing
many of all ages and classes.</p>

<p>The governor-general of the islands sent a squadron to pursue the
pirates, but they accomplished <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314"
href="#pb314">314</a>]</span>nothing. From Zamboanga Adjutant Francisco
Alvarez went out alone to encounter them; he captured the caracoa of
the pirate Gani, a relative of Sal&eacute;, and of thirty captives whom
the latter was carrying away. Alvarez freed twenty-two&mdash;afterward
going to an island of Jol&oacute;, where he captured twelve Moros.
Bobadilla, in answer to his message, on November 8 received pressing
orders to return to Manila without loss of time, the governor yielding
so far as to allow that he might leave in the fortress of Zamboanga at
most fifty Spaniards. This was equivalent to condemning those
unfortunates to a sure death, and the Jesuit fathers protested against
it, saying that necessarily they would incur the same fate; but finally
the supreme authority of the islands decided upon the total abandonment
of the posts <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href=
"#pb315">315</a>]</span>above mentioned. Nevertheless Bobadilla, with
the object of encouraging the Lutaos and leading the Moros to believe
that he was not abandoning the post, sent in pursuit of them Don Juan
de Morales Valenzuela, with two caracoas, to the islands called
&ldquo;Orejas de Liebre,&rdquo; on January 2, 1663; but on the fourth
of the same month he received a new and more positive order from the
captain-general, dated October 11, that without delay or any excuse he
must abandon Zamboanga. At sight of this, Bobadilla warned Morales that
the withdrawal must be made, as was done on the seventh&mdash;as
promptly as possible fulfilling the said imperious mandate, convinced
that it was now altogether impossible to oppose so plain a
decision.</p>

<p>The governor of Zamboanga made a solemn surrender of the fort to the
master-of-camp of the Lutao natives, Don Alonso Macombon, receiving
from him an oath of fidelity to hold it for the king of Espa&ntilde;a
and defend it from his enemies; but Don Alonso refused to include among
these the sultan of Mindanao, on the pretext that he had not sufficient
strength to oppose the dreaded Corralat. The governor, fearing his
defection, did not leave him any artillery. The Jesuits also
surrendered to Macombon their houses and churches, carrying away the
images, ornaments, chalices, and books; and six thousand Christians
remained in Zamboanga exposed to the rage of the Mahometans. Some
Lutaos, although not many, decided to go to the province of
Ceb&uacute;, or to that of Dapitan; others scattered through
Jol&oacute; or Mindanao in search of safety, returning to their former
religion.</p>

<p>The abandonment of our military posts in Mindanao <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316">316</a>]</span>was, although it
is excused by the embarrassed condition of the capital of the islands,
an exceedingly imprudent measure, since, in order to provide for an
uncertain danger, the Visayan Islands were left exposed to another
which was more immediate and real&mdash;to say nothing of the
retrogression that must necessarily result to our domination among the
natives of Mindanao, where at that time over seventy thousand
Christians lived. The pirate who could cause such a panic in the
authorities of Manila, and occasioned so great losses to the
undertaking of subduing the Mahometan Malay pirates, died without
carrying out his threats.</p>

<p>During the government of Don Juan de Vargas (1679), the sultan of
Borneo sent an embassy to ask that mercantile dealings might be
established with Filipinas; and Vargas in his turn sent another and a
very distinguished one, headed by Sargento-mayor Don Juan Morales de
Valenzuela. In 1701 occurred in the south of Filipinas an event as
tragic as unusual. The sultan of Jol&oacute; went to visit the ruler of
Mindanao, for greater ostentation taking with him as escort a squadron
composed of sixty-seven vessels. At sight of such a retinue the sultan
of Mindanao, Cutay<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2956src" href=
"#xd0e2956">12</a> (the successor of the noted Corralat), feared that
the other had designs that were not peaceable, and commanded that the
mouth of the river should be closed; but the sultan of Jol&oacute;,
offended thereat, dared the other to a personal combat. This challenge
was accepted, and the two sultans engaged in a hand-to-hand contest, so
fierce that each slew the other; and immediately war was kindled
between the two peoples. The Joloans, breaking down the stakes which
closed the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href=
"#pb317">317</a>]</span>river, retired to their own island with many
weapons and spoils. The new ruler of Mindanao asked aid from the
governor of Manila, Don Domingo Zub&aacute;lburu; but the latter
advised that they should lay aside their dissensions, and for that
purpose sent the Jesuit Father Antonio de Borja, who was able to attain
his object. (Montero y Vidal, <i lang="es">Hist. pirater&iacute;a</i>,
i, pp. 244&ndash;252. Cf. Comb&eacute;s, <i lang="es">Hist.
Mindanao</i>, col. 610&ndash;640.)</p>

<hr class="tb">
<p>The king of Jol&oacute;, on the contrary, had for many years
maintained peace and friendly relations with the Spaniards, much to the
resentment of his chiefs and captains, who derived much more profit
from hostile raids than from trade and peace; therefore by means of
their confidential agents they spread the report that the king of
Jol&oacute; was talking of sending an armed fleet of twenty joangas to
plunder these islands. The principal author of this was a Joloan named
Linao, who was on intimate terms with the Spaniards, and a Guimbano
named Pal&iacute;a. But the king of Jol&oacute; was very far from
thinking of such changes, and it would have been better for us if we
had not so readily believed it. At this information Don Fernando de
Bobadilla despatched his armada against Jol&oacute;, under General Don
Pedro de Viruega; but when he reached that island he found that the
story that they had spread abroad against the king was false, and Don
Pedro, having talked with him, went back to Zamboanga well satisfied of
his peaceable attitude. But it was not long before the former rumors
against the king of Jol&oacute; were again current; the author of them
was Linao, who desired a rupture [with the Spaniards], so that he with
other pirates might go out on raids against these islands&mdash;in
which enterprise he was more interested than in the peace of <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318">318</a>]</span>his king.
This plan he carried out in company with two others, Libot and
Sacahati, who went cruising with several vessels and did much damage in
the islands of Pintados and Masbate, until they reached the Limbones;<a
class="noteref" id="xd0e2976src" href="#xd0e2976">13</a> from that
place they chased the corregidor of Mariveles, and captured the
provincial of our discalced Augustinian religious and those who were
accompanying him, on his return from visiting the Christian villages of
Bolinao&mdash;although these persons escaped by jumping ashore. But
there was one who could not do this, father Fray Antonio de las Misas
(also a discalced Augustinian), who was coming from Cuyo and Calamianes
to visit those convents. This religious might with good reason be
regarded as a martyr; for with his blood only were the hands of the
renegade Linao stained, as he spared the lives of all the rest in his
greed for ransom. Although the pirates knew that the ransom of this
religious promised them more profit [than that of an ordinary captive],
their hatred to the faith prevailed over their greed, which in these
barbarians is great. This opinion is confirmed by the cruelty with
which they treated an image of Our Lady of the People, which this
religious was wearing, on which they used their crises with furious
rage. This religious was an old man, and greatly esteemed for his
virtue; and in the order he had held positions of honor&mdash;prior of
the convent at Manila, vicar-provincial of Ceb&uacute;, and other posts
in Caraga. He had a brother, a lay member of the Society of Jesus in
these islands, who also suffered the same kind of death at the hands of
the barbarous pirates called Camucones&mdash;a nation <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319">319</a>]</span>as cruel as
cowardly, two qualities which always go together.</p>

<p>Great was the injury which these pirates inflicted on the islands,
and although the alcalde-mayor of Balayan went out against them with
some armed vessels they could not be found, either by him or by some
other vessels which went from Manila for this purpose with a
considerable force of men, on account of the adroitness with which the
Moros concealed themselves, avoiding an encounter&mdash;to such an
extent that the belief was current in Manila that these were not
outside enemies, but insurgent Indians of the country, until a Spaniard
who had been seized by the enemy at the shoals of Mindoro made his
escape from them, and his account undeceived the people of Manila. The
governor despatched an armed fleet in command of Admiral Pedro
Dur&aacute;n de Monforte, a soldier of long experience, but this remedy
came too late; for the pirates, satiated with burning villages,
plundering, and taking captives, had returned to their own country.
Accordingly the armada, having vainly scouted along Lub&aacute;n,
Mindoro, and Panay, returned to Manila, having accomplished nothing
save the expenses which were caused for the royal exchequer, which is
the paymaster for these and other cases of negligence.</p>

<p>The distrust which was felt regarding the maintenance of the peace
by the king of Jol&oacute; perhaps occasioned anger that he had not
prevented these injuries; but he, knowing that if he did not make
amends it would be a cause for justifiable hostilities, sent an embassy
to the governor (who was Don Diego Sarria Lazcano), exonerating himself
and promising to chastise Linao, Libot, and Sacahati; <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320">320</a>]</span>this he did, and
many captives were restored, which was no slight [amends]. King
Corralat raised his false alarms, as he was wont to do when that suited
him, and also made some trifling raids through the agency of the people
of Sibuguey, and threatened the Zebuans at Dapit&aacute;n. But all
became quiet when the office of governor of those coasts was assumed
(June 16, 1659) by Don Agust&iacute;n de Cepeda, a great
soldier&mdash;who died in decrepit old age as master-of-camp of these
Filipinas. Corralat knew, much to his sorrow, the valor of this able
officer, and therefore did not dare to anger him, content that the
Spaniards should leave him in peace. Don Agust&iacute;n, as a prudent
man, determined to try measures to secure peace; and, conferences
having been held, those measures were carried out, with very
advantageous arrangements for our forces.</p>

<p>The frequent raids of these Moro pirates, both Mindanaos and
Joloans, were one of the greatest hardships which these Filipinas
Islands suffered through many continuous years; they were the scourge
of the natives of the islands of Pintados and Camarines, Tayabas, and
Mindoro, as being nearest to the danger and most weak for defense.
These people paid with their beloved liberty for our neglect to defend
them&mdash;not always deserving of blame, on account of the mutations
of the times. Few Spaniards have been the prey of these vile thieves,
except some who were very incautious; but amends have been made for
these by many religious and some secular priests, ministers in the
Indian villages, who have suffered rigorous captivities and cruel
deaths. No small amount of expenditure has fallen on the royal
exchequer; for those pirates have caused innumerable <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321">321</a>]</span>expenses in armed
fleets, most of them useless because the news of the loss did not reach
us until the pirates were returning unhurt to their own lands. At times
it has given even the governors and captains-general of these islands
plenty to do in defending them from these pilfering thieves, as we saw
in the first part of this history, in the case of Don Sebasti&aacute;n
Hurtado de Corcuera and others. All the life of Cachil
Corralat&mdash;which was a very long one, for it exceeded ninety
years&mdash;and that of his father Bahisan kept our vigilance
continually on the alert, and caused us to found and maintain the
fortified posts of Zamboanga, Sabanilla, Malanao, and
others&mdash;which caused so much expense and no profits; for the forts
defend only a small space, and the sea has many roads, and thus they
did not hinder the Moro fleets from sallying forth whenever they chose.
Moreover, Corralat had all the Lutaos for spies, on account of their
great reverence for him, and because they were in secret as much
Mahometans as himself; for never is a Lutao found who has not been
circumcised, or one who eats pork&mdash;and it is this which
constitutes their Mahometanism, as also having many wives and being
enemies of Christians; for in other respects they are atheists, and do
not know what the Koran is or what it contains. And, as I have heard
from military men who have experience in these wars, the only restraint
upon these Joloan and Mindanao enemies is in armed fleets, which go to
search for them in their homes and inflict on them all the damage they
can, without going inland; for the Spaniards will not find any one
there on whom to avenge themselves, since the inhabitants are safe in
their thick forests and on impregnable heights. <span class="pagenum">
[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322">322</a>]</span></p>

<p>After so many years of misfortunes the divine mercy took pity on
these poor natives, on whom the cruelty and greed of the Moros had so
long fattened, selecting as an agent the very Corralat who had been the
cause of the past havoc. With old age and experience he came to see the
injury which was resulting to his people (and most of all to the kings
of Mindanao) from having enemies so valiant as the Spaniards had proved
to be; and therefore while he lived he maintained peace with Manila,
with friendly relations and the benefit of commerce on both sides. And
when his death arrived, which was at the end of the year 1671, he left
his nephew and heir, Balatamay, strictly charged to keep the peace,
with heavy curses and imprecations, according to their custom; and his
people obeyed him so well that for a long time no raid was heard of;
nor was there any by the Camucones, who are subject to Borney. The king
of Jol&oacute;, Pagui&aacute;n, has preserved the same peace and
friendship; for all the Moro tribes of these regions reverenced
Corralat as if he were Mahoma himself. For he was a Moro of great
courage, intelligence, and sagacity, besides being exceedingly zealous
for his accursed sect, and a great sorcerer&mdash;for all of which he
probably has met condign punishment. (Diaz, <i lang="es">
Conquistas</i>, pp. 564&ndash;567.)</p>

<p>The governor [<i>i.e.</i>, Manuel de Le&oacute;n, in 1674] commanded
Juan Canosa Raguses, a skilful builder of lateen-rigged vessels, to
construct two galleys; these sailed very straight and light, and did
good service in frightening away the Camucones, pilfering and
troublesome pirates, who in most years infested the Pintados Islands
with pillaging and seizure of captives. These are a barbarous, cruel,
and cowardly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href=
"#pb323">323</a>]</span>people, and they cannot have one of these
traits without the others. They inhabit a chain of small islands, which
extend from Paragua to Borney; some of them are Mahometans and others
heathens. They have done much harm to the islands of Bisayas, which
they ravaged quite at their ease&mdash;so much so that in the year 1672
they carried away the alcalde-mayor, Don Jos&eacute; de San Miguel, as
we have mentioned elsewhere. They have a great advantage in the extreme
swiftness of their vessels, which enables them to find their defense in
flight. Their confidence and boldness went so far that they ventured to
infest the coasts of Manila. The provincial, Fray Jos&eacute; Duque,
while going to visit the convents in the islands of Pintados, came very
near being captured with his companion, Fray Alvaro de Benavente; for
they were attacked by a squadron of these pirates near the island of
Marinduque, where they would have been a prey to Moro cruelty, if they
had not been favored by the divine kindness. [This acted] through the
agency of Captain Francisco Ponce, a veteran soldier, who killed the
captain and another of the pirates; and also of a sudden wind, which
gave wings to the champan for placing itself in safety. With the
building of these galleys the Camucones were inspired with such terror
that for many years they did not venture to sally out for their usual
raids, so much in safety as before. The first time, Sargento-mayor
Pedro Lozano went out to scour the seas through which the Camucones
might come to make their raids. In the following year, Captain Don
Jos&eacute; de Novoa went out&mdash;a brave Galician, the encomendero
of Gapang&mdash;and as commander of the second galley Captain
Sim&oacute;n de Torres, an able soldier from Maluco; and they <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324">324</a>]</span>scoured the
coasts of Mindanao, committing some acts of hostility, their sole
object therein being to cause more terror than harm. And thus it was,
that with the fear which those piratical tribes had conceived of the
galleys neither Joloans, Mindanaos, nor Camucones dared, so long as
these lasted, to commit their former ravages. The same thing occurs
whenever there are galleys, even though they do not go out to sea and
are shut up in the port of Cavite. It is therefore very expedient to
keep vessels of this sort, in order to be free from the invasions of
those pirates. In view of this, Governor Don Domingo de
Zab&aacute;lburu built two other galleys, which was the cause of the
Joloans, Mindanaos, and Camucones remaining, throughout his term of
office, within their own boundaries, although they had been in previous
years, as we have seen, a continual plague to these islands. (Diaz, <i

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" href= 
"#xd0e2924src" id="xd0e2924">11</a></span> &ldquo;Hardly had Morales
reached the islands, when a new despatch arrived from Manila, repeating
the same orders. The silence of the Spaniards [<i>i.e.</i>, regarding
their first order to leave the fort], and the hurried preparations that
were made that very night for the withdrawal of Morales, inflamed the
injured feelings of the Lutaos, nor could any argument repress them.
The governor did not attempt to do more than console them, in order
that they might prudently decide what they should do; he told them that
the Spaniards would never forsake them, and that if the Lutaos would
follow them there were places in the islands, with equal and even
greater advantages, where they could live; that Corralat was friendly,
and the Spaniards would charge him to maintain friendly relations with
them, which they could with good reason expect, as he was of the same
nation as themselves; that if he should not fulfil this obligation,
occasion would not fail the Spaniards to avenge them. He also said that
they could, with the forts which he left to them, easily defend
themselves from their enemies; and finally, that they should await the
ultimate decision which would be brought by General Don Francisco de
Atienza on his way to Maluco, since it might improve the condition of
affairs.</p>

<p class="footnote">&ldquo;Little impression did these arguments, which
the Spaniards offered by way of consolation, make on the Lutaos. The
tyrannies that they would experience when left to their own government
had no respect for kinship, nor was there any law save that of might.
To leave their homes was most difficult, and to transplant their
villages was to ruin them. To defend the fort supplies of ammunition
and food were required, and they had no fund to meet these costs. They
gave way to lamentations and complaints that, as they had served the
Spaniards with their lives, they had roused in their neighbors a mortal
hatred; that, notwithstanding they had become Christians, they were
left abandoned, in the power of the Moros, without instruction, or
defense, or honor. They recounted their services, and their sighs grew
heavier, while they declared as false the promises made to them <span
class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e2932" href="#xd0e2932">293n</a>]</span>in
the beginning, which drew them away from obedience to their natural
king; and that with such an example [as this of the Lutaos before them]
the peoples [of Mindanao] would not change sides in order to please a
nation so unreliable [as the Spaniards]. The Subanos also presented
their piteous remonstrances that as a people of the hill-country, and
of timid disposition, they were exposed to greater misfortunes. They
went to the fort and renewed their importunities, saying that the
Spaniards were deserting and abandoning them [notwithstanding] their
humble submission, and leaving them to be slaves of their enemies; that
although they had maintained the Spaniards with their tributes,
provided their houses with their products, and embraced their faith,
contented with the freedom which followed Spanish protection, yet now
their liberty remained at the mercy of greed, the Spaniards profiting
by their lives for the sake of keeping up intercourse with the
Macassars and Malayos; and that it was too much to be endured, to leave
in such infamous subjection vassals so obedient as they. The governor,
his heart pierced by their pathetic expostulations, could give no other
satisfaction than his own anxious hopes. In the midst of these limited
and sad consolations, with the arrival of the succors for Terrenate
came anew the severe orders [for abandoning the forts]; the governor
was now unable to give them courage, for lack of means, and all were
disconsolate; but it was necessary to execute the rigorous
order&mdash;those who remained being as sorrowful at it as were those
who were going away, and each one endeavoring to make his <span class= 
"pagenum">[<a id="xd0e2934" href="#xd0e2934">294n</a>]</span>decision
and to suit it to this emergency. Some went to Mindanao, others to
Jol&oacute;, and others to Basilan; many dispersed in the coasts of
Zamboangan, the people of Don Alonso Macombon remaining here with him;
and a few determined to follow the fortunes of those who retreated
thence, going to settle at Dapitan and Zeb&ugrave;.... In the vessels
had to be placed more than a thousand souls, and the military supplies.
It was a grievous abandonment, by which more than a thousand Christians
were left exposed to the cruelty of the Moros.... In great part it was
due to the obstinacy of the Jesuits, who, regarding the allowance of
fifty men as insufficient, compelled its total abandonment. Such
garrisons have been and are sufficient to oppose the Moros in the
remaining presidios; and the same would be enough in Zamboangan if the
great extent which must be guarded, on account of the size of the fort,
were reduced to a little, demolishing the less important part [of the
fortifications]. But their profound thoughts feared lest that fort
would afterward remain thus scantily garrisoned, and that it would not
make so much show or its administration be so conspicuous; nor would
there be expended in the allowances [for it] so large sums, which they
converted to their own advantage.... Soon there were representations
made at the court of injury resulting from its desertion, and
consequent royal decrees for its reconstruction, which did not take
effect until long afterward.&rdquo; (Concepci&oacute;n, <i lang="es">
