<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>The period covered by this volume is short&#8212;only the years 1582&#8211;83, which close the second decade of Spanish occupation of
the Philippine Islands; but in that time occur some events of great importance, and certain influences which deeply affect
early Philippine history are revealed. The coming (in 1581) of the zealous and intrepid bishop, Domingo de Salazar, was a
red-letter day for the natives of the islands. The Spanish conquerors are ruthlessly oppressing the Indians, caring but little
for the opposition made by the friars; but Salazar exerts as far as possible his ecclesiastical authority, and, besides, vigorously
urges the king to shield those unfortunate victims of Spanish rapacity. Various humane laws are accordingly enacted for the
protection of the natives; but of course this interference by the bishop occasions a bitter hostility between the ecclesiastical
and the secular powers&#8212;perhaps never to be quieted. With Salazar come Jesuit fathers, who establish in the islands the missionary
work of that order. In 1582 Japanese pirates begin to threaten Luz&oacute;n, but are defeated and held in check by the Spanish troops.
In 1583 occur two most notable events: one of these is the appointment for the islands of a royal Audiencia, or high court
of justice&#8212;especially ordered by <a id="d0e192"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e192">5</a>]</span>the king to watch over and shield the Indians; the other is the opening there of a branch of the Inquisition or Holy Office.
Fuller details of all these matters are herewith given in the usual synopsis of documents.

</p>
<p>In a letter dated June 16, 1582, Governor Pe&ntilde;alosa reports that the conversion of the natives is making good progress, but
there are not enough missionaries. He recommends that a convent be established in every city and village; and that missionaries
be sent directly from the mother-country, rather than from New Spain, as in the latter case they soon become discontented
after coming to the Philippines. He complains because the Franciscans have gone to China; he renews the plea advanced by former
officials for the conquest of that country, but regards the present Spanish force in the Philippines as inadequate for that
purpose. Meanwhile, he is endeavoring to strengthen the colony, and has founded the town of Ar&eacute;valo in Panay. Another new
town is being established&#8212;Nueva Segovia, in Luzon. Pe&ntilde;alosa has sent an officer to Maluco, and the Jesuit Sanch&eacute;z to Macao,
to pacify the Portuguese there when they shall learn of the change in their rulers&#8212;the dominion over Portugal having passed
to the crown of Spain. He criticizes the administration of his predecessors, saying that they followed no plan or system in
disbursements from the royal exchequer.

</p>
<p>The governor thinks that the customs duties heretofore levied in the islands&#8212;three per cent on both imports and exports&#8212;are
too small; and he has decided to raise the rate to five per cent for merchants in the Philippines, and seven for those in
Mexico. He is endeavoring to extend the commerce of the <a id="d0e198"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e198">6</a>]</span>islands, and for this purpose is sending ships with goods to Panama and Peru. He has sent one piece of heavy artillery to
the viceroy of Peru, who asks Pe&ntilde;alosa for more; this is for the defense of the Strait of Magellan. The commerce between the
Philippines and New Spain is increasing. Pe&ntilde;alosa commends the Jesuit missionaries who have come to the islands, and advises
that more of them be sent thither. He is building forts and ships for the defense of the islands. He remonstrates against
the recent royal decree which ordered the liberation of all Indian slaves held by Spaniards in the Philippines; and closes
by asking some personal favors.

</p>
<p>By the same mail which conveys the governor&#8217;s letter is sent an account of the islands and their people, written by a soldier
named Miguel de Loarca, Who was one of the earlier conquerors and settlers there. Beginning at Ceb&uacute;, as the first settlement
was made therein, he describes each island then known to the Spaniards in that group&#8212;noting its size, contour, and population;
and enumerating the encomiendas assigned therein, the officials in the Spanish settlements, the products of the island, etc.
With this information Loarca incorporates many interesting details regarding the social and economic condition of the natives.
After this preliminary survey, he describes at some length the religious beliefs of the Pintados or Visayan Indians; these
vary, as held by the coast dwellers and those of the mountains. He relates their notions about the creation of the world and
the origin of man, the condition of departed souls, and the deities who control their destiny. Many of these beliefs are,
of course, childish, crude, and superstitious; yet some indicate considerable <a id="d0e202"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e202">7</a>]</span>imagination and poetic fancy. They have various deities, and their priests are usually women; their religious traditions are
preserved in songs. Their mortuary and mourning customs are described. A chapter is devoted to the institution of slavery
among these peoples&#8212;its nature and causes, and the value and status of the slave. Their marriage customs are described at
length, with the status of women among them, the penalties for unfaithfulness, the causes for divorce, etc. There is considerable
curious information regarding the fauna and flora of the islands. Loarca then proceeds to relate similar particulars about
the Moros of Luzon; they adore a divinity called Bathala, &#8220;the lord of all,&#8221; or Creator. His ministers, who are deities of
rain, harvest, trees, the sea, etc., are called <i>anitos</i>, and worshiped and invoked accordingly; they intercede for the people with the great Bathala. These Moros are governed by
chiefs, who enact and administer such laws as seem necessary for the preservation of good order&#8212;adultery, murder, and theft
being the chief crimes, which are punished by a system of fines, or by the enslavement of those who are without means to pay
them.

</p>
<p>The recently-arrived bishop, Domingo de Salazar, writes (June 20, 1582) to the king, imploring redress for the wrongs and
sufferings endured by the Indians, who are continually oppressed by the Spanish officials placed over them. An affidavit made
by some Indian chiefs relates their grievances. As a result of this ill-treatment, the native villages are rapidly being depopulated.

</p>
<p>A letter from the royal factor in the Philippines, Juan Baptista Roman (June 25, 1582), relates the encounter of the Spaniards
with some Japanese <a id="d0e211"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e211">8</a>]</span>pirates who have raided the province of Cagayan in Luz&oacute;n, and implores speedy aid from Mexico against this enemy. A letter
evidently written by Pe&ntilde;alosa, although unsigned (July 1, 1582), mentions the fight with the Japanese, and asks for re&euml;nforcements
of troops. More funds are also needed for extra expenses incurred, and especially for emergencies which often arise in the
islands.

</p>
<p>Two papal decrees (September 15 and October 20, 1582) found the Philippine province of the Dominican order, and grant indulgences
to those who go thither as missionaries. An unsigned document (1582?) enumerates the &#8220;offices saleable&#8221; in the Philippine
Islands; and recommends some changes in the methods of filling them, in view of the prevalent abuses. Captain Gabriel de Ribera
addresses (1583?) to some high official a letter complaining that Pe&ntilde;alosa&#8217;s administration is a bad one, and injurious to
the welfare of the islands.

</p>
<p>In the same year Bishop Salazar writes a memorial regarding affairs in the islands, for the information of the king and his
royal Council of the Indias. He begins by describing the present scarcity of food supplies in Luz&oacute;n. This is the result of
sending to work in the mines the Indians of Pampanga, which province has hitherto been the granary of the island. The Spaniards
also compel the natives to work in the galleys, and at many other tasks, so that they have no opportunity to cultivate their
fields, and are even deprived of suitable religious instruction. Greedy Spanish officials have monopolized all local traffic,
and have set their own price on all provisions, from which some have made great profits. Salazar&#8212;who has with good reason
been styled &#8220;the Las Casas of <a id="d0e217"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e217">9</a>]</span>the Philippines&#8221;&#8212;enumerates a melancholy list of injuries and opressions inflicted upon the hapless natives by their conquerors,
and urges in most forcible and eloquent language that they be protected from injustice and treated as human beings. He cites
from the royal decrees the clauses which make such provisions in behalf of the Indians, and claims that most of these are
continually disobeyed. The Indians held by the royal crown suffer even greater oppression than do those in private encomiendas.
As a result of all these evil deeds on the part of the Spaniards, the Indians have come to abhor the Christian faith, and
many remain pagans; while those who are nominally Christians are so through fear rather than choice. The preachers who are
sent to them ought to go without military escort, and the en&ccedil;omenderos should be compelled to fulfil their duties toward the
Indians in their charge.

</p>
<p>The bishop then describes the status of the Chinese traders who come to the Philippine Islands. Vexatious dues have been levied
upon the Chinese in Manila; they have been herded together in one dwelling, apart from the other residents of the city; and
a special warden, with arbitrary power, has been placed over them. Besides, they have been compelled to sell their goods at
much below their value, and have frequently been plundered; and reparation for their wrongs has been denied. As a consequence,
Chinese goods have almost disappeared from the market, and the few articles seen are sold at exorbitant prices. Other traders
who come to Manila are also burdened with numerous unjust and arbitrary exactions.

</p>
<p>Salazar complains that the Spaniards enslave the <a id="d0e223"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e223">10</a>]</span><span class="corr" title="Source: Indialls">Indians</span>, and, despite all remonstrances made by the priests and friars, refuse to liberate their slaves. The natives are oppressed
by the officials, and are at the mercy of lawless, because unpaid, soldiers. The encomenderos refuse to pay tithes, and the
royal officials say that they have no instructions to pay the bishop; he is thus greatly straitened in means, and can do but
little to aid the unfortunate natives or the poor Spaniards. The governor proposes to levy an additional tribute on the Indians;
the clergy and the friars hold a conference regarding this matter, and decide that it may reasonably be levied, in order to
support the expenses of protecting the natives from their enemies, and of instructing them in the true religion. Nevertheless,
the bishop advises that no additional tribute be imposed until the king shall have opportunity to examine the question, and
order such action as he deems best. The soldiers in the Philippines have left behind them (in Spain, Mexico, and elsewhere)
families whom they have practically abandoned for many years. Salazar desires the king to order that these men be sent back
to their homes, or obliged to bring their families to the islands. Again he recurs to the wretched condition of the natives,
and asks that suitable provision be made for an official &#8220;protector of the Indians;&#8221; and that to this post, now temporarily
filled, the bishop may have the right of nomination. He also asks that to the city of Manila be granted an encomienda, to
provide means for conducting municipal affairs and meeting necessary expenses. He recommends a reward for Ensign Francisco
de Due&ntilde;as, who has just returned from an important mission to Ternate&#8212;whither he went with official announcement of the transfer
of the Portuguese <a id="d0e227"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e227">11</a>]</span>settlement there to the Spanish crown, which is peaceably accomplished. The Franciscan missionaries who went to China have
been brought back to the islands by the governor, who forbids them to go away again without his permission. The bishop intercedes
for them with Pe&ntilde;alosa, but in vain. This is but an instance of the frequent conflicts between the bishop and the civil authorities,
who hinder rather than aid his efforts. Salazar closes his letter with advice to the king as to the officials who ought to
be sent to these islands.

</p>
<p>A document of especial interest is that (dated March 1, 1583) which gives instructions for the commissary of the Inquisition
who is to reside in the Philippines. Great care must be exercised in the choice of that official; he must be very discreet
in his actions, and observe most strictly the rule of secrecy in all transactions connected with his office and proceedings.
All cases of heresy are to be referred to the Holy Office; accordingly, no cognizance of such cases is to be taken by bishops
or other ecclesiastical dignitaries. The commissary is warned to control his temper, to be careful and thorough in his investigations,
and to report to the Holy Office any cases of disrespect or disobedience to his commands. Careful instructions are given for
procedure in receiving denunciations against suspected persons, on which are placed various restrictions, as well as upon
arrests made in consequence of such accusations. The commissary is expected to investigate various crimes, especially that
of bigamy; but he should, when possible, leave its punishment to the regular courts. In case of any accusation for this or
other crimes, he should send to the Inquisition at Mexico all available <a id="d0e231"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e231">12</a>]</span>information regarding the accused; in certain cases the latter should be sent to Mexico. The royal officials of justice are
required to assist the commissary on his demand, and the public prisons are at his disposal; but he may at his own discretion
select a special and secret place of imprisonment for a person arrested by him. The prisoner is to be promptly despatched
to Mexico, to be tried by the Inquisition there. The commissary is warned not to sequestrate the property of the accused,
but to see that it be administered by some capable person. Funds to provide for the prisoner&#8217;s journey and his food, clothing,
and other necessary expenses are, however, to be taken from his property&#8212;enough of it for this purpose being sold at public
auction. None of these procedures shall apply to the Indians, who shall be left under the jurisdiction of the ordinary ecclesiastical
courts; but cases involving Spaniards, mestizos, and mulattoes shall be tried by the Inquisition. Its edicts against certain
books shall be solemnly read in public, for which procedure instructions are given. The commissary must visit the ships arriving
at the ports, and examine their officers according to his instructions; but this applies only to Spanish ships which come
from Spanish possessions. The especial object of such visitation is to confiscate any books condemned by the Inquisition which
may be conveyed by the ships. Doubtful cases are left to the commissary&#8217;s discretion, since he is at so great a distance from
Mexico.

</p>
<p>Another valuable document is the decree which provides (May 5, 1583) for the establishment and conduct of a royal Audiencia
(high court of justice) in Manila. Provision is made for a house wherein <a id="d0e235"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e235">13</a>]</span>this court shall sit, and for its powers and the scope of its jurisdiction; and instructions are given for its course of procedure
in the various matters which shall come before it. Certain duties outside their judiciary functions are prescribed for its
members; among these are the oversight of the royal exchequer, and inspection of inns, apothecary shops, and weights and measures.
The Audiencia shall despatch to the home government information regarding the resources of the islands, the condition of the
people, their attitude toward idolatry, the instruction bestowed upon Indian slaves, etc. It shall fix the prices to be asked
by merchants for their wares; keep a list of all the Spanish citizens, with record of the services and rewards of each; audit
the municipal accounts of the city where the court is established; and allot lands to those who settle new towns. Its powers
in regard to ecclesiastical cases of various kinds are carefully defined. Felipe orders that the papal bulls be proclaimed
only in those towns where Spaniards have settled, and then in the Spanish language; and that the Indians shall not be compelled
to hear the preaching of them, or to receive them. Specific directions are given for the manner in which the Audiencia shall
audit the accounts of the royal treasury, and it may not expend the moneys therein; it shall also audit the accounts of estates
in probate. Its members must especially watch over the welfare of the conquered Indians&#8212;punishing those who oppress them,
and seeing that the natives receive religious instruction, in which the Audiencia and the bishop shall cooperate; and various
specific directions are given for the protection of the Indians and their interests. The duties of the officials subordinate
to the Audiencia&#8212;<a id="d0e237"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e237">14</a>]</span>fiscal attorney, alguazils, clerks, jail-wardens, and others&#8212;are carefully prescribed, as also are those of advocates. The
remainder of this document will be presented in <span class="smallcaps">Vol</span>.&nbsp;VI.

<h2>Letter from Pe&ntilde;alosa to Felipe II</h2>
<p>Royal Catholic Majesty:

</p>
<p>There has now returned one of the ships by which I wrote in the year 80. Until now no word has been received of the other
ship to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, in which I sent a duplicate report. Therefore in this letter I shall refer to some of the most essential
points which I had written, and will give a report also of what is presented for the first time.

</p>
<p>This country is advancing rapidly in the conversion of the natives, and they are quick to embrace baptism and the knowledge
of our holy faith. If the harvest is not greater, it is for lack of workers. However, the repartimientos held by the Spaniards
contain but few persons and yield small income; and thus they cannot assist in supplying all the instruction necessary, because
of the cost of maintaining the religious. In this ship sail two religious of the order of St. Augustine, in order to beseech
your Majesty to grant them grace in several necessary points. One is father Fray Juan Pimentel, in whom are found many excellent
qualities. Among the things that they desire, I consider it very important that your Majesty order convents to be built in
all the villages and cities. There should be a convent of six <a id="d0e310"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e310">17</a>]</span>religious in each of the villages, and one of twelve in the cities. May your Majesty see to it that these be provided, from
the alms which are customarily given to those who serve in the instruction of your Majesty&#8217;s towns. It is very inconvenient
that for lack of the means of support, the priests who are sent here and are occupied in instructing the Indians, are not
able to carry on their work. If there were convents, none but the most approved persons would be sent to occupy them, as is
necessary for the result that they strive to attain by their doctrine, lives, and examples.

</p>
<p>It is very necessary that the friars who are sent to these islands come directly from Espa&ntilde;a, and that they have not remained
any length of time in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. As that land is so prosperous and wealthy, and the affairs and teaching of the Indians
have attained such progress, they become much discouraged in this country, and try to return to New Spain or go elsewhere.

</p>
<p>As a result of this feeling, there set out in April of this year the custodian of the order of St. Francis, with seven other
friars of this city. They sailed without my approbation in a fragata which had been secretly made ready; and went to Macau,
a town in China which is inhabited by Portuguese. The ships from India belonging to Portugal stop there for trade, as well
as those going to Japan. It seemed to me that God would not sanction their departure, nor would your Majesty be pleased to
have them leave this country, where there are so many native Christians and where religious are so needed, since they had
been sent hither at your Majesty&#8217;s expense, to discharge the obligations of the royal conscience; but <a id="d0e316"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e316">18</a>]</span>without my order, and at such a time, they set out. We even yet do not know the attitude taken by your Majesty in regard to
the affairs of Portugal. I am determined to send after them, stop them, and prevent their voyage, although there have been
and are now serious embarrassments in the way. If your Majesty does not approve of my plans, may it be commanded that everything
be carefully weighed and considered. Three years ago four friars of the same order made that identical voyage without permission
of the governor then here. It is not possible to check them if their superiors do not remedy the affair. If your Majesty should
order that no Portuguese friars come hither, it would be best for your royal service.

</p>
<p>The royal estate has advanced, and is now progressing by the means which I have provided for its increase. Although the rents
and profits have been doubled since I came, their sum is but little, and does not amount to thirty thousand pesos annually.
This is not sufficient for the salaries and expenses of the fleets and artillery, and therefore the treasury remains in debt,
although not to such an extent as formerly. Everything possible is done to cut down expenses for your Majesty, and thus a
great reduction has been made therein. This has been done with many supplies which are usually provided from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a,
since I am informed that many articles which are brought thence at great cost can be supplied here. It is a mistake for your
Majesty to think that these islands can serve the royal estate with a considerable sum of money, for I can say that that will
not be for many years yet. But it is right that your Majesty should value this land <a id="d0e320"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e320">19</a>]</span>highly, on account of its proximity to China. Without doubt that is the finest country in the world, since it has so many
people and so great wealth. This island of Lu&ccedil;on is not a hundred leagues distant from China, and ought to profit much from
the endeavors made there by the vassals of your Majesty. It is considered just that war should be made against them; and this
and their conquest depends only on the way in which God inclines the heart of your Majesty.

</p>
<p>Until his divine Majesty is pleased to appoint that time, it would be a serious error to undertake a war with the people who
could be sent from here. I have determined to occupy them in finishing the settlement of these islands. Accordingly, the village
of Arevalo&#8212;on the island of Panay, fifty leagues from this district&#8212;has just been settled. The land is very fertile and the
inhabitants are rich. They are almost all at peace, and the town is increasing in population because of the good and healthful
character of that country.

</p>
<p>This year I have sent people to settle the city of Segovia in a province called Cagayan, in this island, a hundred leagues
from this city. It is the frontier of China, and much benefit is expected from its settlement&#8212;for it is the best-situated
port, with a harbor of greater depth, for the ships which sail in the line from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a and Peru; and it is so near to
China that one can cross thence in three days. For the sake of the future I consider it very important to have that frontier
settled. I sent for the settlement thereof Captain Juan Pablos de Carrion, with about a hundred picked men. They go in good
order, well provided with artillery, vessels, ammunition, <a id="d0e326"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e326">20</a>]</span>and with the approbation and blessing of the church. God will be served through them, and your Majesty as well.

</p>
<p>In the years 80 and 81 there came to these islands some pirate ships from Japan, which is located about four hundred leagues
from here. They did some injury to the natives. This year, as warning was received that ten ships were being prepared to come
to these islands, I have sent a fleet to the place where they are accustomed to come. This fleet is composed of six vessels,
among them a ship and a galley well supplied with guns. I will send later advices of the outcome. The Japanese are the most
warlike people in this part of the world. They have artillery and many arquebuses and lances. They use defensive armor for
the body, made of iron, which they have owing to the subtlety of the Portuguese, who have displayed that trait to the injury
of their own souls.

</p>
<p>Although I have had no letter or advices of the state of affairs with Portugal, it seemed to me in the year 80, that we should
live with great care and circumspection on account of what might happen, as the Portuguese are so quarrelsome, and especially
if Don Antonio, the Prior of Crato,<a id="d0e332src" href="#d0e332" class="noteref">1</a> should come here. In order to try to ascertain the state of affairs at Maluco and at Macau, the post held by the Portuguese
in China, I have sent for this purpose to the islands of Maluco the sub-lieutenant Francisco de Due&ntilde;as with four companions.
He is well-instructed as to what course to pursue. Likewise I sent to <a id="d0e338"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e338">21</a>]</span>Macau Father Alonso Sanchez of the Society of the Name of Jesus, a person in whom are combined many admirable traits.<a id="d0e340src" href="#d0e340" class="noteref">2</a> They are going to try to prepare and calm the people for the time when certain news will be had of the occurrences in Portugal.
They will bring back a report of everything which has been learned there of affairs, even to the defeat of the Infante Don
Antonio. I realize that it is necessary to be diligent in order to effect the desired ends, or that at least I shall be informed
of the conditions there, and the forces with which the Portuguese are supplied.

</p>
<p>The governors who have been here have used no system in making disbursements from the royal exchequer. They have followed
the plan of spending as they saw fit and convenient to your Majesty&#8217;s royal service. I have continued in the same way because
in no other manner would it be possible to support it or make advancement. The expenses here are for the most part extraordinary,
and of small sums, as the royal exchequer cannot allow more owing <a id="d0e351"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e351">22</a>]</span>to its limited resources, as I have already said. For expenses of considerable sums, as those incurred in despatching fleets
for our settlements, against pirates, and in paying the salaries of corregidors and alcaldes-mayor, the officials ask me to
request an order from your Majesty. I have no other way of complying with the obligations of your royal service. Will your
Majesty please to have an order sent me, in order that when I consider it convenient for your royal service, I may make payments
from the royal treasury? It is not possible otherwise to maintain your royal service. The total expenditure is but slight,
and is watched and regulated with all care.

</p>
<p>There are several men, newly-arrived in this country, who are always writing advices and opinions in respect to the aforesaid
matter and others. It would be best for the royal service that the decrees despatched therefor be sent submitted to the consideration
of the governor. As we are so far away it is right, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, in order to insure progress, that confidence be placed in the governor.

</p>
<p>By other letters, I have already given advices of the imposition of three per cent as duties on both importations and exportations
of the merchandise of both Spaniards and Chinese. A freight charge of twelve pesos per tonelada is also imposed. Considering
their large profits, these duties are very moderate. For this reason, and because the instructions brought by the adelantado
Legaspi decreed the collection of five per cent from the people of this country and seven from the merchants of Mexico, and
as the collection at that rate cannot, in good conscience, be too long delayed, I have decided to enforce <a id="d0e360"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e360">23</a>]</span>it. Your Majesty will provide according to the royal pleasure. In my opinion, the regulations made are moderate, just, and
desirable for the royal service.

</p>
<p>I also gave information that I had sent a ship to Piru in the year 81. From all that I hear, it is important for the progress
of this kingdom that it trade and have commerce with the others; therefore I am sending this year another ship, for private
individuals, to Panama. Consequently, I shall have ships sent to the principal kingdoms held by your Majesty in the Indias
and the Southern Sea. The ship for Peru carried some artillery to be delivered to the viceroy, among them a piece of eighty-five
quintals. I decided to do this, knowing the need there for heavy artillery, as the strait had to be fortified.<a id="d0e364src" href="#d0e364" class="noteref">3</a> I think that the artillery arrived at an opportune season, for I have had a letter from the viceroy, Don Martin <a id="d0e376"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e376">24</a>]</span>Enriques, in which he begs me to let him know if I could supply him with heavy artillery. I am only waiting for [the return
of] the ship which I sent a year ago, in order to furnish him with as much as I can, for I consider that your Majesty will
be thereby served.

</p>
<p>The viceroy, Count de Coru&ntilde;a,<a id="d0e380src" href="#d0e380" class="noteref">4</a> regrets that I despatched ships to a point outside of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. I can well believe that he has been persuaded to this
view by the merchants interested in trade, as they do not wish the gains to be divided. Those who consider the subject without
prejudice, however, will understand the great advantages which might follow thereby to this country, in that people will come
hither and commerce be opened upon all sides.

</p>
<p>The affairs of this country are improving to such an extent that the cargo of this ship bound for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a is worth four
hundred thousand pesos. It carries two thousand marcos of gold without taking into account the large quantity of goods intended
for Panama.

</p>
<p>In the past year, 81, there came from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a three Theatins; and two priests, Father Antonio Sede&ntilde;o<a id="d0e387src" href="#d0e387" class="noteref">5</a> and Father Alonso Sanches, zealous <a id="d0e401"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e401">25</a>]</span>servants of God and having great erudition. They are doing much good, and I consider them as excellent persons for this country,
and think that it would be advantageous to send more.

</p>
<p>In some places which need defense I am having forts built, and for them artillery is constantly being cast&#8212;although there
is a lack of competent workmen, nor are there any in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. It would be well to have master-founders of cannon sent
from Espa&ntilde;a.

</p>
<p>I am also having some galliots and fragatas built, so that I may be supplied with vessels for both present and future emergencies.

</p>
<p>This kingdom was thrown into great confusion by a decree in which your Majesty ordered the liberation of all Indian slaves
held by Spaniards. This affair has caused me much anxiety; for, if it should be immediately complied with, and put into execution
without allowing any term of grace, this kingdom would be placed in a sad state for many good and very forcible reasons. Of
these, and of the measures which I took in regard to this, your Majesty will be informed at greater length. Accordingly, I
refer you to that report, and beseech your Majesty that the decree be greatly amended, since this is a very important matter.

</p>
<p>By the death of Salvador de Aldave, who served as treasurer of your royal estate, in place of the master-of-camp, Guido de
Lave&ccedil;ares (the proprietary <a id="d0e411"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e411">26</a>]</span>holder, who died), I appointed to the said office Don Antonio Jufre, my step-son. He came with me to serve your Majesty in
these islands, and I consider that he possesses the necessary qualifications for the requirements of the office. He has fulfilled
its duties thus far; and now he has gone to the settlement of the city of Segovia, as treasurer and purveyor of the fleet.
I beseech your Majesty to have the goodness to ratify his appointment to said office.

</p>
<p>In my instructions your Majesty granted me the favor and permission to obtain a repartimiento of Indians from each of the
new settlements&#8212;to be in all three repartimientos. As, to enjoy this favor, I must live for a longer time than is assured
by my poor state of health, I beg your Majesty kindly to allow me to take one of the repartimientos from one of the towns
which is already discovered and settled, and which is at present unoccupied; this is only that I may serve your Majesty with
more strength. May our Lord guard your Catholic royal Majesty with increase of kingdoms and seignories, as we your servants
desire. Manila, June 16, 1582. Royal Catholic Majesty, the most humble servant of your Majesty, who kisses the royal feet
and hands.

Felipe II the allegiance of the Portuguese at that place. Stanley, in his edition of Morga&#8217;s <i>Sucesos</i> (p. 402) says: &#8220;The library of the Academy of History, Madrid, contains a Chinese copy of a chapa, by which the mandarins

<p>los q<sup>e</sup> se mueren de su enfermedad si son mo&ccedil;os di&ccedil;en q<sup>e</sup> los mangalos q<sup>e</sup> son los duendes les comen las asaduras y que por por esta causa, se mueren, porq<sup>e</sup> ellos no entendien que ay corrup&ccedil;ion de humores q<sup>e</sup> causan las enfermedades y los que mueren, biejos di&ccedil;en q<sup>e</sup> el Viento llega y les aRebata las almas y que destos q<sup>e</sup> asi mueren los arayas q<sup>e</sup> es Una &ccedil;ierta Par&ccedil;ialidad de pueblos se van a vna sierra muy Alta que se llama <a id="d0e2869"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e2869">123</a>]</span>mayas q<sup>e</sup> esta en la ysla De panay y los q<sup>e</sup> llaman yligueynes q<sup>e</sup> son los &ccedil;ubuanes, boholanes, bantayanes, van sus almas con el dios que llaman, sisiburanen a vna sierra muy alta q<sup>e</sup> en la ysla De Burney <i>El dios sidapa</i>.

</p>
<p>La causa porque matan a los esclauos q<sup>e</sup> diximos quando muere algun prin&ccedil;ipal di&ccedil;en ques antiguamente, <a id="d0e3045"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e3045">129</a>]</span>que a la cuenta q<sup>e</sup> ellos di&ccedil;en a mas de diez mill A&ntilde;os vn prin&ccedil;ipal que se llamaua marapan estandose proueyendo pidio a vn esclauo suyo vn poco

prin&ccedil;ipal, o por quitar le la manta en publico y dexarla desnuda o ser causa q<sup>e</sup> por huyr o defenderse le caya q<sup>e</sup> esto tienen por mu&ccedil;ha afrenta

</p>
<p><i>ladrones</i>.

la suerte del sacrifi&ccedil;io era semejante a la de los pintados q<sup>e</sup> llamauan vn catalonan, q<sup>e</sup> es lo mismo q<sup>e</sup> Vaylan, entre los Pintados que es Como sa&ccedil;erdote y este ha&ccedil;ia El sacrifi&ccedil;io pidiendo Al anito lo que le querian pedir juntando

</p>
<p><i>Se&ntilde;orio de los moros</i> Entre estos moros ay ni mas ni menos behetria q<sup>e</sup> en los pintados, q<sup>e</sup> auia prin&ccedil;ipales En sus Barrios a quien obede&ccedil;ian q<sup>e</sup> castigauan sus delitos y les dauan las leyes qe auian de guardar y en los pueblos donde Auia diez o do&ccedil;e prin&ccedil;ipales no mas
Vno dellos El mas Rico era el q<sup>e</sup> obede&ccedil;ian todos, tienen en mu&ccedil;ho la antiguedad del linaje y ansi para ser se&ntilde;or aprouechaua mu&ccedil;ho, quando ha&ccedil;ian sus leyes
para gouernar su Republica el mayor prin&ccedil;ipal a quien obede&ccedil;ian los demas juntaua todos los demas prin&ccedil;ipales del pueblo en

demas prin&ccedil;ipales, y luego Venia vn pregonero que llaman Vmalahocan ques propriamente mayordomo y tomaua vna canpana, y <a id="d0e4113"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4113">169</a>]</span>salia por El pueblo y en cada barrio pregonaua las hordenancas, q<sup>e</sup> se auian hecho y El pueblo rrespondia que las obedecia y asi yva de en pueblo en Pueblo por todo El destrito de aquel principal
y de alli adelante el que yncurria en la pena era lleuado Al principal y El le condenaua en ella y si la pena era de muerte
y El condenado decia que queria ser esclauo se le perdonaua y quedaua esclauo, eran tambien jue&ccedil;es los demas Prin&ccedil;ipales,
cada vno en su barrio y quando se offrecia algun negocio de Calidad mandaua El principal mayor juntar todos los demas Principales
para sentenciarlo, y concluydo con Voto de todos los demas usauan lleuar derechos, y no auia Cosa se&ntilde;alada en ellos, mas de
lo que el proprio juez decia q<sup>e</sup> le diessen.

</p>
<p><i>Casamientos</i> Estos moros Vsauan sus casamientos de la mesma orden que Vsan los pintados en el dar El dote De suerte q<sup>e</sup> si El varon se apartaua y descasaua contra la voluntad de la muger, tenia perdido El dote y se quedaua Ella sin el y si la
muger dexaua al marido Era obligada &agrave; Voluer el dote y si Cometia adulterio y por ello la dexaua el marido Voluia El dote
doblado, y si aCaso la muger dexaua al marido por casar se con otro aquel con quien se Cassaua estaua obligado a dar al primer
marido El dote q<sup>e</sup> auia dado y mas otro tanto de pena o lo q<sup>e</sup> El juez mandase, la muger adultera siendo prin&ccedil;ipal tenia pena de muerte cojiendola el marido en ynfragante y El adultero
tambien y los podia matar, sin pena alguna, y si aCaso mataua al vno y se escapaua El otro auia <a id="d0e4134"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4134">171</a>]</span>Guerra abierta entre las parentelas, hasta q<sup>e</sup> El otro moria y si aCaso se esscapauan ambos, Rescatauan la vida a peso de oro, y si eran prin&ccedil;ipales tenian &ccedil;ien taes de
pena, &ccedil;inquenta la muger y &ccedil;inquenta El delinquente, y con esto les perdonauan y quedauan amigos, y si eran timaguas tenian
menos pena&#8212;

</p>
<p><i>Guerras</i> Las guerras y la esclauonia dellos tenian ni mas ni menos q<sup>e</sup> los pintados.

</p>
<p><i>ladrones</i> Era ley entre los naturales &ccedil;erca de los ladrones q<sup>e</sup> Al que ha&ccedil;ia hurto de menor cantia; q<sup>e</sup> eran hasta quatro taes q<sup>e</sup> son veynte pesos y siendo de alli para aRiba, era hurto mayor tenia de pena Voluer El oro y despues la condena&ccedil;ion, al arbitrio
del juez y era pena pecuniaria, y siendo hurto mayor q<sup>e</sup> se entendia de quatro taes para aRiba tenia de pena esclauo, y si el Vrto llegaua a vn cati de oro era la pena de muerte
o de ha&ccedil;erlo esclauo, a el y a sus hijos, y los q<sup>e</sup> estubiesen dentro de su Casa.

</p>
<p>Era tambien ley q<sup>e</sup> por El primer hurto era la pena pecuniaria y por El segundo esclauonia, y de alli para aRiua, era de muerte y si se le perdonaua
era Como esta di&ccedil;ho aRiua ha&ccedil;iendole esclauo a el, y a su muger y hijos, y El hijo q<sup>e</sup> probaua estar fuera de casa, y posar en casa por si suya o de Algun pariente como Viuiese por si no se entendia la pena con

<h2>Relation of the Filipinas Islands by Miguel de Loarca</h2>
<p><i>A treatise on the Philipinas islands, in which an account is given of all the islands and peoples reduced to the obedience
of his royal Majesty, King Don Phelippe, our sovereign, and of the settlements that the Spaniards have made there; together
with an account of the form of government among both the Spaniards and the natives, and of some customs of the Indians and
Moros of these islands</i>.


</p>
<p>Although the chief settlement of the Spaniards in these islands is the city of Manila, and the island of Lu&ccedil;on, wherein it
is situated, is the finest and richest of all the islands discovered (on which account we should discuss and begin to write
about it first), yet, since the island of &Ccedil;ubu was the first to be settled, and served as the starting-point for the conquest
of all the others; and, too, because your Lordship has allowed me so short a time in which to write this relation; and because
I know them better, I shall commence with the island of Cubu and those adjacent to it, the Pintados. Thus I may afterward
speak more at length on matters pertaining to this island of Lu&ccedil;on and its neighboring islands&#8212;where, because the natives
are Moros, they differ somewhat from the former in customs, mode of life, and language.
<a id="d0e4333"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4333">30</a>]</span></p>
<p>It cannot be denied that the men who have come to this country have lacked the desire for investigation, since neither ecclesiastics
nor laymen have undertaken to relate what occurred in this land at the time of its conquest; and, although it is said that
father Fray Alonso de Buy&ccedil;a has written a large volume in Mexico on this subject, I doubt the assertion, because I have seen
his letters which came last year, in this ship &#8220;Sanct Martin.&#8221; In these letters he asked for exact information about events
in this region of sixteen years ago, because he mistrusted the accounts which have been sent to him from here; he also requested
any one of the settlers of this land, who should write, to give a faithful account of all things for times to come. At present,
it will be difficult to arrange such information, and much time will be needed therefor. In view of this and the short time
before me, I shall not treat of that particular subject; but I shall fulfil what his Majesty has ordered from your Lordship
by his royal decree; and I shall also add a description of some customs of the natives, in order that, since they are his
Majesty&#8217;s vassals, he may know of the barbarous life from which he has delivered these natives, and of the civilized manner
in which they now live under his gracious sway.

<p class="div2"></p>
<h3>Chapter First</h3>
<p><i>Of the island of &Ccedil;ubu, and of the other islands under its jurisdiction</i>.

</p>
<p><i>Island of &Ccedil;ubu</i>. The island of &Ccedil;ubu, the first to be settled by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, has a circuit of nearly a hundred leagues and a
length of about fifty leagues, for it is very narrow. At the two extremities it is, at the widest place, about twenty leagues
wide. One extremity, the one lying toward the north, is called Burula. The other extremity, which we call Las Cabe&ccedil;as and
the natives Sanbuan, lies at the south; for, as is inferred, this island runs nearly north and south. One cannot sail very
close to the island; because all along the coast where the town of &Ccedil;ubu is situated are to be found bays that curve in different
directions. On the other and western side of the island the land lies almost northeast and southwest. The entire island contains
about three thousand five hundred Indians, living in different, and for the most part small, villages. Here I shall mention
only the principal ones, for the others are small, numbering only from eight to ten houses.

</p>
<p><i>Jaro</i>. Jaro is under the charge of an encomendero who also holds an encomienda elsewhere; the village is inhabited by five hundred
Indians.

</p>
<p><i>Daraguete</i>. Daraguete is also an encomienda, with two hundred Indians.

</p>
<p><i>Pe&ntilde;ol</i>. El Pe&ntilde;ol is also an encomienda, with two hundred Indians.

</p>
<p><i>Jaro</i>. Jaro is likewise an encomienda, with two hundred Indians.
<a id="d0e4364"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4364">34</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Temanduc</i>. Temanduque is also an encomienda, with five hundred Indians.

</p>
<p><i>Temanduc</i>. In the same province of Temanduque another encomendero has seventy Indians; and it is also an encomienda.

</p>
<p><i>Barile</i>. The village of Barile is another encomienda; it is inhabited by four hundred natives. It is also an encomienda.

</p>
<p><i>Burugan</i>. The village of Burugan has about seventy Indians. It is also an encomienda.

</p>
<p><i>Candaya</i>. The province of Candaya has three hundred and fifty Indians, belonging to two encomenderos. It is also an encomienda.

</p>
<p>No Spaniards are to be found in any of the principal encomiendas, in all this province, although fourteen of them possess
holdings therein. These Spaniards, because they were inhabitants of the town of &Ccedil;ubu, received each two or three small villages,
together with service from the Indians, fowls, and other means of maintenance; for the principal encomiendas were distant
from them thirty or forty leagues, more or less. On the other side of the above-mentioned native communities, at about two
arquebus-shots from the Spanish town of Ssantisimo Nombre de Jesus (thus called because an image of the child Jesus, of the time of Magallanes, had been found there, and was held in great
reverence by the Indians), is a village of the natives belonging to the royal crown, with about eight hundred Indians. The
commander Miguel Lopez de Legazpi exempted this community from paying tribute; for they had always taken sides with the Spaniards,
and had helped them to conquer some of the other islands.

</p>
<p><i>Observations on the island of &Ccedil;ubu</i>. In this village <a id="d0e4394"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4394">36</a>]</span>live thirty Spaniards, and as many encomenderos. Counting both citizens and soldiers, fifty or sixty Spaniards ordinarily
reside there.

</p>
<p><i>Alcalde-mayor in &Ccedil;ubu</i>. The governors of these islands have always appointed an alcalde-mayor, at a salary of three hundred pesos taken from the
fines forfeited to the royal treasury; and the royal treasury not being sufficient, the alcalde-mayor has not, as yet, appointed
any deputy. There are six regidors, who, up to the present time, have been elected annually. The past governors appointed
also an alguazil-mayor, whom they can remove and replace at their pleasure. There is no remuneration for this last office;
and it is therefore given to an encomendero, who is generally one of the leading citizens. There are also two alcaldes-in-ordinary,
and one notary for the cabildo and the public. If all these officials were not also encomenderos, they would be unable to
support themselves; for the town possesses no commerce which comes within their reach. The town has the best port of these
islands, and it was for this reason that Miguel Lopez de Legazpi founded a settlement there. It was he who founded the above-mentioned
town, in the year of sixty-four. Perhaps the traffic with Maluco may prove of advantage to the town, for there is no other
place in its vicinity with which any commerce could be carried on. Its neighborhood is poor, and all the vast district round
about lacks gold mines or gold-placers, except in the island of Mindanao&#8212;and that but little&#8212;as will be described later. The
island of &Ccedil;ubu produces a small quantity of rice, borona, and millet and little or no cotton; for the cloth which the natives
use for their garments is made from a kind of banana. From this they make a sort of <a id="d0e4400"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4400">38</a>]</span>cloth resembling colored calico, which the natives call <i>medri&ntilde;aque</i>. In these islands great value is set upon the land which can produce rice and cotton, because cotton and cloth find a good
market in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. The condition of the people will be described when I shall speak of all the Pintados in general, for
they all are very similar. All are provided with fowls, swine, a few goats, beans, and a kind of root resembling the potatoes
of Sancto Domingo, called by the natives <i>camotes</i>. After rice, fish is the main article of maintenance in this and other islands, for it abounds in all of them, and is of
excellent quality in this island of &Ccedil;ubu. Although deer have been found in all the islands discovered hereabout, there are
none here; and if any should be brought hither from elsewhere they would immediately die.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Matan</i>. To the south of the settlement of &Ccedil;ubu, about two arquebus-shots from it, lies the island of Matan where Magallanes was
killed; it forms the port of &Ccedil;ubu. The island is about four leagues in circumference, and half a league wide; it has a population
of about three hundred Indians, scattered through four or five small villages, all of which are under the jurisdiction of
the town of &Ccedil;ubu.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Vohol</i>. On the other side of the island of Matan, and farther south, about eight leagues from the settlement of &Ccedil;ubu, lies the island
of Vohol, which is an encomienda with two thousand Indians. The natives of this island are closely related to the people of
Cebu and are almost one and the same people. Those inhabiting the coast regions are mainly fishermen. They are excellent oarsmen;
and, before the arrival of the Spaniards, they were accustomed <a id="d0e4416"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4416">40</a>]</span>to cruise about in their vessels on marauding expeditions. They are also traders. There was once a large town in this island
[Bohol], which, shortly before the Spaniards came hither, was plundered by the people of Maluco, and the majority of its inhabitants
were dispersed throughout the other islands, where they now dwell. The settlements inland among the mountains are small and
poor, and are not yet wholly under subjection. In this island, as well as in the many nearby uninhabited islets&#8212;these latter
abounding also in fish&#8212;there is great abundance of game, both deer and boars. The island is about forty leagues in circumference,
and eight or ten leagues wide.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Negros</i>. West of the island of &Ccedil;ubu lies another island, called by the Spaniards Negros, because its mountain districts are inhabited
by some blacks. The Indians have given it various names, such as Nayon, Mamaylan, and others, all taken from the names of
villages in different parts of the island. It contains some six or seven thousand Indians; but the number of blacks has not
been ascertained, because of their hostility. The side of the island facing &Ccedil;ubu is sparsely populated; for it has only one
settlement worthy the name, which is situated on the river Tanay, and half of the Indians on that river are natives of Bohol.
The southern side, facing the island of Panay and the town of Arevalo, is thickly settled; for it contains the rivers Ylo,
Ynabagan, Bago, Carobcop, and Tecgaguan&#8212;all fertile districts, rich in foods, such as rice, swine, and fowls; and abounding
in medri&ntilde;aque, although there is no cotton. The coast facing &Ccedil;ubu lies about two and one-half leagues from that island, and
on the side <a id="d0e4422"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4422">42</a>]</span>facing the island of Panay and the town of Arevalo there is a like distance; so that two straits are made with these islands
of Zubu and Panay respectively. The side toward &Ccedil;ubu has three encomenderos; and that toward Panay and the town of Arevalo
has eight. All other encomenderos hold encomiendas in other parts of the island. This island is about ninety leagues in circumference,
and about twelve or thirteen leagues wide. None of its villages belong to his Majesty.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Fuegos</i>. Near the straits formed by Negros Island and that of &Ccedil;ubu, there is an island which we call the island of Fuegos. It has
a circuit of ten leagues, and a population of nearly two hundred Indians, and is a part of an encomienda. This island produces
a great quantity of wax.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Camotes</i>. East of the island of &Ccedil;ubu are two small islets, each about five leagues in circumference. They are called the islets of
Camotes. The two are inhabited by about three hundred Indians, and are under the jurisdiction of the city of &Ccedil;ubu. The people
are poor, although they possess some wax and a great quantity of fish. The villages are small, consisting of only seven or
eight houses each. These islets are about three leagues from the island of &Ccedil;ubu, and seven from the city of that name.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Baybay</i>. About three leagues farther east lies the island of Baybay, or Leyte, as it is also called. It is a large and well-provisioned
island, although the people dress in medri&ntilde;aque. Leyte is thickly settled; it may have a population of fourteen or fifteen
thousand Indians, ten thousand of whom pay tribute because that has been a people hard to conquer. There are twelve encomenderos;
but his Majesty <a id="d0e4436"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4436">44</a>]</span>owns none of the Indians. This island is about eighty leagues in circumference, and fifteen or sixteen wide. Its principal
settlements and rivers are Vaybay, Yodmuc, Leyte, Cavigava, Barugo, Maraguincay, Palos, Abuyo, Dulaque, Longos, Bito, Cabalian,
Calamocan and Tugud. This island possesses neither mines nor gold-placers; the only cloth it produces is medri&ntilde;aque, which,
as I have said before, resembles calico, and is made from a kind of wild banana.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Panaon</i>. Between this island and that of Mindanao, which lies north and south, is the island of Panaon. It is about eight leagues
in circumference, and three leagues wide. The population is poor, and numbers only about one hundred men, who belong to one
encomendero.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Siargao</i>. Twelve leagues from the island of Panaon, and next to the island of Mindanao, is the island of Siargao, which is about fifteen
leagues in circumference and six leagues wide. It may have about four hundred inhabitants, and its villages are built around
rough and dangerous estuaries. There is only one encomendero. The people are poor because of their indolence; for although
there are numerous small islets near this island, which contain many gold-placers, they do not work them. They give as a reason
that, if the corsairs should discover that they were working these mines, they would come hither to take them captive; but
even now, when no one can molest them, they do not work the mines, and hence we may infer that their poverty is mainly due
to sloth.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Ma&ccedil;agua</i>. West of the island of Baybay is a small island called Ma&ccedil;agua, about which father <a id="d0e4450"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4450">46</a>]</span>Fray Andres de Urbaneta related so many wonders. It is four leagues in circumference and one league wide; it has about sixty
inhabitants, as well as an encomendero. The people are poor and wretched, possessing nothing but salt and fish.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Maripipe</i>. At the other side, northeast from the island of Baybay, lies the island called Maripipe. It is a very mountainous island,
and by reason of its great roughness it is barren. It is about seven leagues in circumference and two and one-half leagues
wide. It has a population of about one hundred Indians.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Limancaguayan</i>. Nearer the strait and cape of Espiritu Santo, and about three leagues from Maripipe, is another island, called Limancaguayan.
Like Maripipe it has a circumference of about seven leagues, and a population of one hundred. This island produces rice and
medri&ntilde;aque. These two islands belong to one encomendero, together with the island of Fuegos, which we mentioned above.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Masbate</i>. Farther to the north-northeast of this island of Leyte lies the island of Masbate, which is about thirty leagues in circumference,
and six leagues wide. It has about five hundred Indians, who belong to one encomendero. It has also gold mines from which
much gold was dug, for the natives of Camarines went thither to work them; but they have left the place on account of the
Spaniards, and therefore the mines are not worked. The island of Leyte is considered the centre of all the islands mentioned
above, because they all lie in its neighborhood.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Bantayan</i>. About two leagues north of the island of &Ccedil;ubu lies the island of Bantayan. It is about eight leagues in circumference and
two leagues <a id="d0e4468"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4468">48</a>]</span>wide, and has a population of about one thousand Indians; this and the above-mentioned island of Vohol are under the charge
of one encomendero. Its inhabitants are well-disposed. They have large fisheries, for there are many shoals near the island.
There is also a pearl-fishery, although a very small one. The land produces millet and borona, but no rice, for all the island
has poor soil notwithstanding that it is level. Some of the natives of this island cultivate land on the island of &Ccedil;ubu, which,
as I have said, is two leagues away. The island abounds in excellent palm-trees&#8212;a growth common to all the Pintados islands,
for all of them abound in palms.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Capul</i>. Capul is the name of the island forming a strait with the island of Lu&ccedil;on. Through this strait pass all the ships which
come from Espa&ntilde;a. Capul is about twelve leagues in circumference and four leagues wide. It has about five hundred Indians,
and belongs to one encomendero. Its inhabitants are poor and have rice and medri&ntilde;aque.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Viri</i>. Still nearer the cape of Espiritu Santo, and in the strait itself, lies the island of Viri. It is about five leagues in
circumference and two leagues wide. It has a population of about one hundred. This island and that of Ma&ccedil;agua are under one
encomendero.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Ybabao</i>. Southeast of the island of Baybay, lies the island of Ybabao, or as it is also called, the island of Candaya [also Tandaya].
It is about one hundred and ten leagues in circumference. No one has yet gone through the land, and therefore its width is
not known. They say that its population is as large as that of the island of Baybay, and that it is a fertile and well-provisioned
island. The people <a id="d0e4482"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4482">50</a>]</span>seen by the Spaniards will number about five thousand Indians, who are scattered through the following villages:


</p>
<ul>
<li>The village of Daguisan.

</li>
<li>The river of Ylaga.

</li>
<li>The river of Yba.

</li>
<li>The river of Basey.

</li>
<li>The villages of Hubun.

</li>
<li>The villages of Balingigua.

</li>
<li>The villages of Guiguan.

</li>
<li>The river of Sicavalo.

</li>
<li>The river of Bolongan.

</li>
<li>The river of Sibato.

</li>
<li>The village of Tinagun.

</li>
<li>The River of Calviga.

</li>
<li>The estuaries of Ulaya.

</li>
<li>The river of Paguntan.

</li>
<li>The river of Napundan.

</li>
<li>The river of Bolo.

</li>
<li>The river of Pono.

</li>
<li>The river of Gamay.

</li>
<li>The villages of Panpan.

</li>
<li>The river of Catubi.

</li>
<li>The river of Volonto.

</li>
<li>The river of Yuatan.

</li>
<li>The river of Pagaguahan.

</li>
<li>The village of Baranas.

</li>
<li>The village of Arasan.</li>
</ul><p>


</p>
<p><i>Islands of Bantac</i>. Close to the island of Ybabao, on its eastern side and in the gulf of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a [<i>i.e.</i>, Pacific Ocean], are to be found two islands, called Bantac. They are thinly populated, and according to what the Indians
say, no one has yet set foot on them.
<a id="d0e4543"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4543">52</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Verde Island</i>. On this same side, opposite the town of Guiguan on the gulf side, lies Verde Island. It is about eight leagues in circumference,
and four leagues wide. It contains about one hundred and fifty Indians.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Canaguan</i>. On the western side, opposite the river of Tinahon, lies the island of Canaguan, which is about four leagues in circumference
and one league wide. It contains about one hundred men.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Caguayan</i>. The island of Caguayan lies very close to the western side of the island of Ybabao, and is three leaguo in circumference
and one league wide. Its population numbers two hundred men.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Batac</i>. The island of Batac, which is near this place, contains one hundred men. All these islands which have been mentioned are
under the charge of the encomenderos of &Ccedil;ubu, and under the jurisdiction of the city by the same name; so that, counting each
island by itself, and that part of the island of Mindanao which has been explored, the jurisdiction of the city of &Ccedil;ubu extends
over a circuit of six hundred and sixty-seven leagues.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Mindanao</i>. Of all the islands discovered up to the present time, Mindanao is supposed to be the largest, although but few of its inhabitants
are friendly&#8212;almost none, in fact&#8212;and those dwell along the coast. The Spaniards have explored only about one hundred and
fifty leagues of this island, namely, from the river of Catel to the principal river, which is called Mindanao. From the city
of &Ccedil;ubu one has to sail southeast to reach the nearest point of Mindanao, which is called Dapitan. Dapitan has a port, and
lies in the middle of the discovered section of the island. Once this section was thickly populated, <a id="d0e4564"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4564">54</a>]</span>but now there are only a few inhabitants left. It produces rice and gold, for there are gold-placers and mines all over the
island; but the gold is found in so small a quantity that it can hardly be detected. From Dapitan to the point of Cinnamon
there are more than thirty rivers whose banks are settled.

</p>
<p><i>Observations on the Island of Mindanao.</i> But those who live along the shore are very few, and are called Lutaos&#8212;a name applied to a tribe of people in this land,
whose only means of sustenance is derived from fishing; and who take their wives, dogs, cats, and all their possessions in
their boats. The fish that they catch they trade with the people of the mountains.

</p>
<p><i>Tree-dwellings of the mountaineers of Mindanao.</i> The mountaineers of this island build their houses in certain trees, so large that in each one a house is built which can
contain forty or fifty married men and their families; the tree serves as a fortress against the enemy. As far as seen this
region abounds in wax. The land is very rough and mountainous, and the inhabitants dress in <span class="corr" title="Source: med i&ntilde;aque">medi&ntilde;aque</span> cloth.

</p>
<p>Forty leagues from Dapitan, on the side facing Maluco, is Cavite Point, where there is abundance of cinnamon; this is the
district which extends toward Maluco.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Taguima.</i> Not far from this Cinnamon Point, lies the island of Taguima, which is about fourteen leagues in circumference, and four
leagues wide. It has a population of about five hundred Indians, with two encomenderos. In all parts of Mindanao are found
a great many civet-cats. The Portuguese ships, on their way from Malaca to Maluco for cloves, pass by this island, and formerly
did much <a id="d0e4583"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4583">56</a>]</span>harm to the natives, often committing acts of treachery while making that passage. Civet-cats are found in all parts of the
island of Mindanao; but the people are poorly supplied with food and clothing.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Soloc</i>. Twenty leagues from this Cinnamon Point lies the island of Soloc. Its inhabitants are Moros from Burney. It was discovered
at the same time as was the river of Burney. The island is about twenty-four leagues in circumference, and is said to have
somewhat more than one thousand inhabitants. It is said to have elephants and a fine pearl-fishery. It belongs to one of the
encomenderos of &Ccedil;ubu, and is within the jurisdiction of that city.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Mindanao, continued</i>. All the region northeast of Dapitan, as far as the river of Butuan, is under one encomendero, except the villages of Gonpot
and Cagayan. These two villages, on account of their production of cinnamon, are under his Majesty, although their population
is small, not exceeding two hundred men. The same encomendero has charge also of the district between Dapitan and almost to
the Cinnamon Point, so that his encomienda in this island of Mindanao is of nearly sixty leagues&#8217; extent; he is also encomendero
of the above-mentioned island of Soloc, and holds another encomienda in the island of &Ccedil;ubu. With all this, he is poor [and
dying of hunger: <i>crossed out in original MS</i>.], and cannot help laying hands on all the discovered land of Mindanao

</p>
<p><i>Rivers: Paniguian, Ydac, Matanda, Ytanda, Tago, Ono, Beslin&#8212;all of which have about three thousand men, for the most part
hostile</i>. Around the river Butuan, which belongs to Guido de la Ve&ccedil;aris, dwell about six hundred Indians who are in this <a id="d0e4600"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4600">58</a>]</span>island. Farther on are to be found the rivers Surigao, Parasao and others, all poor regions notwithstanding their gold-placers.
The same may be said of the rivers Paniguian, Ydac, Matanda, Ytanda, Tago, Ono, and Beslin&#8212;all of which have a population
of about three thousand, mostly hostile.

</p>
<p>Two attempts have been made to explore the chief river of Mindanao&#8212;the most important of the island, and from which the island
of Mindanao derives its name&#8212;but with little result, for our people have been able to discover only six or seven villages.
Of these villages the principal one is where the petty king lives; others are Tanpacan, Boayen, and Valet, with others, which,
according to what has been seen, have a population of a little more than three thousand, although it is reported that there
are many more than that number.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Camaniguin</i>. Opposite Butuan River, in the direction of &Ccedil;ubu, and between Vohol and the island of Mindanao, lies the island of Camaniguin.
It is about ten leagues in circumference, and has a population of about one hundred Indians. This island is two leagues from
Mindanao. It is a craggy and mountainous island. It produces some wax, and la gente della por la mayor parte anda sienpre muy city of &Ccedil;ubu.

<p class="div2"></p>
<h3>Chapter Second</h3>
<p><i>Of the island of Panay and of the district under its jurisdiction</i>


</p>
<p><i>Island of Panay</i>. Twelve leagues from the nearest point of &Ccedil;ubu, and two and one-half leagues from Negros Island, lies the island of Panay,
the most fertile and well-provisioned of all the islands discovered, except the island of Lu&ccedil;on; for it is exceedingly fertile,
and abounds in rice, swine, fowls, wax, and honey; it produces also a great quantity of cotton and medri&ntilde;aque. Its villages
stand very close together, and the people are peaceful and open to conversion. The land is healthful and well-provisioned,
so that the Spaniards who are stricken with sickness in other islands go thither to recover their health. The natives are
healthy and clean; and although the island of &Ccedil;ubu is also healthful and has a good climate, most of its inhabitants are always
afflicted with the itch and buboes. In the island of Panay the natives declare that no one of them had ever been afflicted
with buboes until the people from Bohol&#8212;who, as we said above, abandoned Bohol on account of the people of Maluco&#8212;came to
settle in Panay, and gave the disease to some of the natives. For these reasons the governor, Don Gon&ccedil;alo Ronquillo, founded
the town of Arevalo, on the south side of this island; for the island runs almost north and south, and on that side live the
majority of the people, and the villages are near this town, and the land here is more fertile. In this town dwell fifteen
encomenderos, who have <a id="d0e4623"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4623">62</a>]</span>among them about twenty thousand Indians, all pacified and paying tribute. Since the town is situated on the side nearest
Negros Island, its nearest neighbor, the above-mentioned governor placed under its jurisdiction the rivers Ylo, Ynabagan,
Bago, Carobcop and Tecgaguan&#8212;which, as has been said before, constitute the best district of Negros Island. For all these
reasons, people flocked thither to build their houses; and the place has become the best-provisioned district in all the islands.
This island of Panay provides the city of Manila and other places with a large quantity of rice and meat.

</p>
<p><i>Alcalde-mayor of Arevalo, with a salary of 300 pesos</i>. The city of this island has one alcalde-mayor, four regidors, one alguazil-mayor, two alcaldes-in-ordinary, and one notary
for the public and for the cabildo. The regidors are elected for life, and the alguazil-mayor remains in office as long as
does the alcalde-mayor. Being a new town, there are few lawsuits; and the notary can depend on no other compensation than
that which he derives from lawsuits among the Indians (for he accompanies the alcalde-mayor on his official visits), and from
the cases which are brought before the law for settlement. This city holds jurisdiction over a circuit of three leagues, but
it possesses no territory of its own.

</p>
<p>The following are the principal communities in this island:


</p>
<ul>
<li>The village of Oton, next to the town.

</li>
<li>The village of Ticbaguan.

</li>
<li>The river Jaro.

</li>
<li>The river Yvahay.

</li>
<li>The river Ajuy.

</li>
<li>The river Harahut.
<a id="d0e4644"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4644">64</a>]</span></li>
<li>The river Panay.

</li>
<li>The river Aclan.

</li>
<li>The village of Antique.

</li>
<li>The village of Bugason.</li>
</ul><p>


</p>
<p>and others of less importance. The alcalde-mayor receives a salary of three hundred pesos, paid from the fines forfeited to
the royal treasury; and if those do not suffice, he will be empowered by the governor and other royal officials to collect
the tribute which his Majesty receives in that island&#8212;from somewhat more than two thousand men, who dwell in the vicinity
of the rivers Haraut, Ajuy, and Panay&#8212;the fifths of the gold which is dug in that region, almost nothing in amount. This town
is about fifty leagues from that of Santisimo Nombre de Jesus in the island of &Ccedil;ubu. As this island contains great abundance
of timber and provisions, it has almost continuously had a shipyard on it, as is the case now at the location of the town
of Arevalo, for galleys and fragatas. Here the ship &#8220;Visaya&#8221; was launched. This island is about one hundred leagues in circumference.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Ymaraes</i>. About two arquebus-shots from the island of Panay lies the island of Ymaraes. It is about twelve leagues in circumference,
and has a population of about five hundred Indians, all of whom are in charge of one of the encomenderos of the island of
Panay. It abounds in rice, cotton, honey, wax, and much game, as is usual in all the islands. It has much timber, which serves
for the shipyards, and for house-building in the neighboring islands. Although of such extent, Ymaraes comes under the jurisdiction
of the town of Arevalo.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Cuyo</i>. Opposite Antique, which is located in the island of Panay, and about sixteen leagues <a id="d0e4664"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4664">66</a>]</span>farther in the same westerly direction, lies the island of Cuyo. This island is also in charge of one of the encomenderos
of the island of Panay, and has a population of about eight hundred. It abounds in rice which bears a reddish kernel, because
the soil is of that color. A great many goats are being raised, for the region is favorable for that. There are large fisheries,
and some pearls are gathered. A large quantity of cotton cloth is woven there, although the cotton is not produced on the
island. Formerly many ships from Burney were wont to come to barter for <i>bruscays</i>, which are a kind of sea-shell which in Sian is used as money, as cocoa-beans are used in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. It is under the jurisdiction
of Arevalo, although the authority of that town has never been exercised therein. This island is twelve leagues in circumference.

</p>
<p><i>Islets of Lutaya</i>. Not far from this island are five [seven] very small islets called Lutaya, Dehet, Bisucay, Cadnuyan, Tacaguayan, Lubit,
and Tinotoan. The people are very poor, and are kept in slavery by the chiefs of the island of Cuyo. These islets, all together,
contain somewhat more than one hundred men. The chief occupation in all these islets is making salt and mats&#8212;the latter from
rushes, for they are a wretched people. These they pay as their tribute. This island is six leagues in circumference.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Osigan</i>. Northeast of the island of Panay and three leagues from its extreme point, lies the island of Osigan, which we call the
island of Tablas. It is about eighteen leagues in circumference, and is quite mountainous. Wax is collected there. It has
a population of about two hundred and fifty Indians, living in small villages.
<a id="d0e4677"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4677">68</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Island of &Ccedil;ibuyan.</i> Six leagues from Osigan lies the island of &Ccedil;ibuyan. It is about twelve leagues in circumference, and six leagues wide. It
has about three hundred Indians, of whom two hundred are under one of the Panay encomenderos. In this island are to be found
very good gold mines, but they are not properly worked, for the Indians are all Pintados, and are very slothful. They belong
to the jurisdiction of Arevalo.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Buracay.</i> About two arquebus-shots from the north point of the island of Panay, lies the island of Buracay. It is about three leagues
in circumference, and one-half league wide. It is inhabited by about one hundred Indians, who cultivate rice there, and in
addition derive profit from some goats.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Anbil.</i> One half league from this island is another island, called Anbil. It is about three leagues in circumference, and one wide.
Its fifty Indians are mostly ship-builders.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Simara.</i> About two leagues from the island of Tablas&#8212;or, as it is also called, Osigan&#8212;lies the island of Simara. It is about four
leagues in circumference, and two leagues wide. It has a population of one hundred and fifty. These people are traders, and
raise goats, and therefore the island is called Cabras [&#8220;Goats&#8221;] Island. It is about twelve leagues from the island of Panay.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Sivaay.</i> Four leagues west of the north point of Panay, is the island of Sivaay. It is five leagues in circumference, and one and
one-half leagues wide, and has a population of seventy Indians.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Similara.</i> About three leagues farther, <a id="d0e4702"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4702">70</a>]</span>toward the island of Mindoro, is found the island of Similara, with a population of ninety Indians. It is four leagues in
circumference, and one league wide. All the people of these islets gather a very scanty harvest; they make salt, and are traders.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Batbatan.</i> South of the north point of Panay, and about one and one-half leagues from that island, lies the island of Bacbatan, with
a population of eighty Indians. The island is about three leagues in circumference, and one league wide. The inhabitants raise
their wheat and produce their wax on the island of Panay. All these islands&#8212;Buracay, Anbil, Simara, Sivaay, Similara, and
Bacbatan&#8212;are under one of the encomenderos of Panay.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Banton.</i> The island of Banton lies about one and one-half leagues from the island of Simara, or Cabras. It is about eight leagues
in circumference and three leagues wide, and has two hundred Indians. The island is very craggy; it abounds in palm-trees,
potatoes, yams, and wax. The people are traders.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Donblon.</i> The island of Donblon lies between &Ccedil;ibuyan and the island of Tablas. It is seven leagues in circumference and three leagues
wide. Donblon is inhabited by nearly two hundred and fifty Indians, and abounds in wax. This island and that of Banton come
under one of the Panay encomenderos, and under the jurisdiction of the town of Arevalo. The jurisdiction of this town extends
also over the islands of Ymaras, Cuyo, Bacbatan, Sivahi, Similara, Buracay, Anbil, Simara, Osaygan, Banton, Donblon, Cibuyan,
and over the larger populated section of Negros Island&#8212;namely, from the cape of Sitaravaan to Siparay, an extent of more than
twenty leagues. Banton, which is the last island of this jurisdiction, <a id="d0e4716"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4716">72</a>]</span>lies about fifty-five or fifty-six leagues from the town of Arevalo.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Cagaian.</i> Sailing south-southeast from the town of Arevalo, one comes to the open sea; for there are no other islands in that direction
except the ones called Cagayan&#8212;two low islets about fifteen leagues from the island of Panay. They are surrounded by many
low reefs; and unless their narrow entry is well known, the ships which go there encounter great dangers. These islands have
about four hundred inhabitants, all of whom are very skilful ship-builders. It is said that a few years ago the natives peopled
these islands in order to fortify themselves by the reefs, for fear of the pirates. Then they undertook to return to the island
of Panay in order to dwell there; but very many of their women died there. Seeing this, as they are soothsayers they returned
to the islands of Cagayan, whence they set out every year, and scatter themselves over all the islands to build ships. These
Indians of Cagayan have made his Majesty&#8217;s ships in these islands, as well as the galleys, galliots, and fragatas. They also
help in repairing and righting ships. Being therefore the most important people in these islands, the adelantado Miguel Lopez
de Legazpi allotted the islands of Cagayan to the encomenderos of Negros Island. Afterwards it seemed best to put them under
his Majesty&#8217;s control. Thus the town of Arevalo holds jurisdiction over an extent of about two hundred and fifty leagues.

<p class="div2"></p>
<h3>Chapter Third</h3>
<p><i>Of the Island of Lu&ccedil;on</i>


</p>
<p><i>Island of Lu&ccedil;on</i>. The island of Lu&ccedil;on is the most important island of the whole group which has been discovered. It is thickly populated and
well-provided with rice and gold-mines. These mines have yielded much gold, especially in the province of Ylocos. This island
is divided into three provinces, the chief of which is that wherein was founded the city of Manilla, the capital of this kingdom
and the seat of the governor. Hither flock more Spaniards than are found in all the other islands. One league and a half from
this city is the port of Cavite, where the ships from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a anchor. The ships from &Ccedil;hina enter also through the river
of this city, for they usually come in great numbers to carry on their trading. His Majesty has a fortress here, with its
governor, three royal officers, one major, and one royal standard-bearer&#8212;all appointed by his Majesty. There are also two
algua&ccedil;ils-mayor&#8212;one of court and one of the city, one government secretary, one notary for the cabildo, and four notaries-public.
Manila is also the seat of the bishop of all the islands; in this city he resides and has his cathedral church. There are
also seven regidors in this city; three of them are proprietary magistrates, and are appointed by his Majesty&#8212;namely, Captain
Juan de Moron, Don Luis Enrriquez, and Pedro de Herrera. The other four are appointed by <a id="d0e4734"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4734">76</a>]</span>the governor&#8212;namely, Captain Graviel de Ribera, Captain Joan Maldonado, Captain Bergara, and Captain Rodrigo Alvarez. There
is also a convent of Augustinian monks, one of descalced friars, and one house of the Company [of Jesus].

</p>
<p>The city is situated midway on the shore of a large bay, about twenty leagues in circumference. The region all about this
bay is fertile, and well-provisioned. The inhabitants are Moros, instructed in that faith by those of Burney. The river has
a fresh-water lake, about five leagues above this city; it is more than twenty leagues in circumference. The district abounds
in rice and cotton. The people possess much gold in the way of trinkets, but there are no mines in this region. This same
race of Moros have made settlements as far as the villages of the Batangas; their number will be told later. They have also
peopled the island of Mindoro and that of Luban, but they are to be found in no other region of these islands. The inhabitants
of the province of Camarines at the eastern end of this island, through whose strait arrive the ships from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, resemble
the Pintados; and even those at the other and southeastern [<i>sc.</i> northern] end of this island, toward the Japanese, also closely resemble the Pintados&#8212;although they do not tattoo <i>[pintan]</i> themselves as the latter do, and bore their ears differently; for in these two provinces there is but little tattooing. The
Pintados tattoo the whole body very gorgeously; but the Moros do not tattoo themselves at all, nor do they bore their ears.
Unlike the men of Visaya, the Moros wear their hair short, although their women bore their ears, but in a very ugly manner.
The Moros inhabit only this district of the bay of Manilla. <a id="d0e4747"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4747">78</a>]</span>with a fifteen-league coast, the most fertile land of this island. The following encomiendas are to be found in the neighborhood
of this city:

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Vatan, eight hundred men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Vitis, with about seven thousand men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Macabebe, with two thousand six hundred men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Calonpite, with about three thousand men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Candava, with two thousand men.

</p>
<p>Near this encomienda is a village which, on account of its antiquity, is called Little Castilla. It belongs to his Majesty,
and has a population of seventy.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Pale, with three hundred men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Binto, with four hundred men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Malolos, eight hundred men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Guiguinto, four hundred men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Catangalan, with eight hundred men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Caluya belongs to his Majesty, and has six hundred men.

</p>
<p>Formerly all the above-mentioned encomiendas had one alcalde-mayor, but since Don Gonzalo came he has appointed the following
officials:

</p>
<p><i>Corregidor of Batan</i>. In Batan, a corregidor, with a salary of one hundred and fifty pesos.

</p>
<p><i>Alcalde-mayor of Lubao</i>. In Lubao, another, with a salary of three hundred pesos.

</p>
<p><i>Alcalde-mayor of Calompite</i>. In Calompite and Macaveve, another, with a salary of three hundred pesos.

</p>
<p><i>Alcalde-mayor of Candava</i>. In Candava and two <a id="d0e4791"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4791">80</a>]</span>other encomiendas, another, with a salary of two hundred pesos.

</p>
<p><i>Alcalde-mayor of Bulacan.</i> In Bulacan and its vicinity, another, with a salary of two hundred pesos.

</p>
<p>One language is spoken in all these encomiendas. Quite near the city, and along the coast from Tondo, which is situated on
the other side of the river of this city, another language is spoken. This village of Tondo belongs to his Majesty, and possesses
a population of one thousand three hundred and fifty Indians.

</p>
<p>The village of Quiapo also belongs to his Majesty.

</p>
<p>The village of Pandacan, which is held by an encomendero, has one hundred and fifty men.

</p>
<p>The village of Santa Maria is under an encomendero, and has a population of [<i>blank space in MS</i>.].

</p>
<p>The village of Capaques has two hundred men, and belongs to his Majesty.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Pasic has one encomendero, and contains two thousand men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Tagui is under one encomendero, and has six hundred and sixty men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Taytay is inhabited by five hundred Indians. All these encomiendas are situated along the river of Manilla,
from Tondo to the lake, and are under the jurisdiction of one alcalde-mayor, who appoints a deputy for Tondo. The alcalde-mayor
has a salary of two hundred pesos; and his deputy, one hundred.

</p>
<p>Around the lake the following settlements are under the jurisdiction of another alcalde-mayor:

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Maribago, three hundred men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Tabuc, with [<i>blank space in MS.</i>].
<a id="d0e4825"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4825">82</a>]</span></p>
<p>The encomienda of Vahi, with two thousand five hundred men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Pila, with one thousand six hundred men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Mayay, with four hundred men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Lumban, with one thousand five hundred men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Maracta belongs to his Majesty, and has six hundred men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Balian, with six hundred men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Sinoloan, with seven hundred men.

</p>
<p>The encomienda of Moron, with one thousand one hundred men.

</p>
<p>The last two encomiendas have a much larger population; but they are hostile, and live in the mountains. All the above-mentioned
encomiendas are found around the lake. Turning toward the coast of Manilla, on the other side of Tondo, we find the following
villages:

</p>
<p>On the coast near Manila are Laguo, Malahat, Longalo, Pala&ntilde;ac, Vacol, Minacaya, and Cavite. All these villages are in the
neighborhood of Cavite, and belong to his Majesty, to whom they pay tribute. On entering the bay opposite the other point,
which is called Batan, is:

</p>
<p><i>Alcalde-mayor for the coast</i>. The encomienda of Maragondon, with four hundred and fifty men. This encomienda of Maragondon, together with all the above-mentioned
coast villages which belong to his Majesty, is under the jurisdiction of one alcalde-mayor, who receives a salary of three
hundred pesos.

</p>
<p>Outside of the bay of Manilla, on the east, are the <a id="d0e4852"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4852">84</a>]</span>villages of the lowlands of Tuley, which belong to his Majesty and pay him tribute.

</p>
<p><i>Corregidor of Balayan</i>. The encomienda of Balayan has six hundred men, with one encomendero; one corregidor is appointed here, who receives a salary
of one hundred and fifty pesos.

</p>
<p><i>Alcalde-mayor of Vonvon</i>. The district around the lake of Bombon has a population of about three thousand four hundred. Then come the villages of
the Batangas district, with one thousand men and one encomendero. These two encomiendas are under the jurisdiction of another
alcalde-mayor. All the land between Tuley and Batangas is inhabited by Moros, who, as we have said above, have abundance of
cotton, and possess much gold handed down to them by their ancestors.

</p>
<p>Proceeding about three leagues from the settlement of Batangas, which we mentioned above, along the coast toward Camarines,
we come to the river of Lobo, on which are about a hundred Indians. Two leagues from Lobo is Maribago, where there are gold
mines; here dwell about one hundred Indians. Farther on is the village of Biga, with a population of about one hundred and
fifty Indians. Next is Galvan, with about another hundred and fifty Indians. All these villages have one encomendero. Farther
along the coast is the river Dayun, with about six hundred Indians; and next, the river Tubi, on which, in the tingues [hills],
are about five hundred Indians.

</p>
<p>Next are the river Carilaya and other small settlements, with a total population of about five hundred Indians.

</p>
<p>Still farther is the river Caguayan, with about two <a id="d0e4868"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4868">86</a>]</span>hundred Indians. All this territory has three encomenderos, and is all under the jurisdiction of the alcalde-mayor of Mindoro.
Here begins the province of Camarines, although a few settlements of little importance may be found between the two regions.



</p>
<p class="div2"></p>
<h3>Chapter Fourth</h3>
<p><i>Which treats of the Camarines Provinces</i>


</p>
<p><i>Provinces of Camarines and Vicor</i>. Farther along the coast near the Pasacao River begin the provinces of Vicor and Camarines, which, as we have said above,
are situated on the east side as you enter the Philipinas islands. Disembarking at the Pasacao River, which is seventy leagues
from the city of Manilla by sea, and journeying three leagues by land, one comes to the Vicor River flowing north; its source
is in the opposite coasts of the island.<a id="d0e4881src" href="#d0e4881" class="noteref">1</a>

</p>
<p><i>Alcalde-mayor of Camarines</i>. Here lies the town of Ca&ccedil;eres, the seat of an alcalde-mayor who receives a salary of three hundred pesos. There are also
two alcaldes-in-ordinary, and six regidors, whom the governor appoints for as long a period as he chooses. <a id="d0e4888"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4888">88</a>]</span>This town of Ca&ccedil;eres is situated in the middle of the entire province, on the banks of the river Vicor. This river district
is allotted to eight encomenderos, seven of whom have in charge about seven hundred Indians each, and the other about two
thousand. Along the same river, his Majesty possesses the villages of Minalagua and Nagua, with two thousand Indians. Following
this river, one comes to a lake called the lake of Libon, which is but scantily populated. The district round about is one
encomienda, with one thousand five hundred Indians living in the village of Libon and its environs. This lake of Libon, lying
in a mountainous region, has many creeks, by which one can easily go to Yguas, Albay, Camarines, Bicagua, and other places.
The town of Ca&ccedil;eres has in all twenty-four encomenderos. Fourteen of them, including the seven above mentioned, have seven
hundred Indians each; one has two thousand; another, that of lake Libon, has one thousand five hundred; and the rest have
about three hundred Indians each. The inhabitants of the Vicor River district pay their tribute in gold and rice, for they
possess these articles in great abundance&#8212;for in this province are the excellent mines of Paracale, sixteen leagues from the
town; they work also the mines of Catanduanes, thirty leagues from the town. The town has no dependencies, nor does it hold
any jurisdiction over other communities. The whole district is under the jurisdiction of the alcalde-mayor of the province
of Laguna. This province has a population of about one thousand five hundred, and is allotted to three encomenderos.

</p>
<p>Albay and Baquian are inhabited by about eight hundred Indians, who are allotted to two encomenderos. <a id="d0e4892"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4892">90</a>]</span>Camarines, with about five hundred men, is under one encomendero.

</p>
<p>Libon is under one encomendero, and has one thousand five hundred men.

</p>
<p>The province of Paracale and its coast, as far as Mahuban, is inhabited by about two thousand men, and is allotted to three
encomenderos. The king owns a share of this province.

</p>
<p>The district around the bay of Yvalon has a population of about one thousand five hundred, being divided between two encomenderos.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Catanduanes</i>. The island of Catanduanes has a population of about four thousand, and is allotted to four encomenderos. The alcalde-mayor
receives a salary of three hundred pesos, which is paid from the fines forfeited to the royal treasury, or from the royal
treasury itself. He appoints no lieutenant, except one for the town when he is absent. The governor appointed a notary for
this town, who, having little to do, attends also to the affairs of the alcalde-mayor, and accompanies him on his tours of
inspection. Thus his various occupations yield him an annual income of nearly four hundred pesos.

</p>
<p>There is also a treasurer in this town, appointed by the governor, at a salary of two hundred pesos. His duty is to collect
the tribute due to his Majesty, and to go every year to Manila to give an account of his work.

</p>
<p>The country is fertile and healthy. It abounds in rice and palm-trees, from which wine and a great quantity of brandy are
made.

</p>
<p>As already said, the natives of this province closely resemble the Pintados&#8212;although the former are more slothful; for they
spend nearly all their time in drinking, <a id="d0e4910"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4910">92</a>]</span>while their wives cultivate the land. Like the Pintados, they are a sociable people, and observe the same customs.

</p>
<p>They all worship the ugly wooden idol, and talk to the demon. They have also many wizards. Not having lived in this province,
I am not acquainted with their manner of sacrifice, nor have I found one who could tell me of it.

</p>
<p><i>Mines</i>. As I have said, there are mines in Paracale, in the bay of Caporaguay, and in the island of Catanduanes. All these districts
are in the neighborhood of the town of Ca&ccedil;eres.

</p>
<p><i>Distances</i>. From Pasacao, one has to follow the coast of the island eastward twenty leagues to Bucaygan, and sixty leagues more to the
northwest, before he reaches Vicor River. All this may be shortened to the three leagues [by land] between Pasacao and the
Vicor River. The distance between Vicor River and the cape of Babuyanes&#8212;situated at the other end of the island, toward Japan,
as above stated&#8212;is one hundred and twenty leagues. The coast between Vicor and Babuyanes is rugged, and extends northwest
and southeast. Not all this land is inhabited, but only three districts of it, namely: the province of Valete, with about
eight hundred Indians; ten leagues farther, that of Casiguran, with about five hundred Indians (a district resembling Ylocos,
which lies on the opposite coast, although the two provinces have no communication, because of the ruggedness of the country);
and, farther on, the province of Alanao River. This last is well peopled, and produces gold and cotton; its native Indians
resemble those of Valete and Casiguran. Besides these three districts, no other settlement on this coast is <a id="d0e4922"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4922">94</a>]</span>encountered until the cape of Babuyanes is reached. From the cape the coast runs east and west until the river of Cagayan
is reached. This is a very large river. It is twelve leagues from the cape to the mouth of this river.

</p>
<p><i>River Cagayan</i>. Cagayan is a river of great volume, although its bar forms shallows. At high tide the bar has two brazas of water, and at
low tide one. On its banks are large settlements with a population of more than thirty thousand. The people gather a great
quantity of rice, and keep many swine. They have also some gold, although there are no gold mines. Their trade is carried
on with the men of Ylocos. This region is unwholesome, especially when the north wind prevails.

</p>
<p><i>Islands of Mandato and Buyon</i>. On the opposite coast, near the island of Lu&ccedil;on, are two inhabited islets, called Mandato and Buyon respectively, each one
about five leagues in circumference, settled by Moros, on account of their lying so near the island of Lu&ccedil;on opposite the
bay of Manila. [<i>Marginal note:</i> &#8220;The island of Lu&ccedil;on curves from the city of Manilla, where the change in direction begins, to the river of Cagayan.&#8221;]

</p>
<p><i>Island of Marinduque</i>. Between the island of Banton and that of Lu&ccedil;on, four leagues from the former and five from the latter, lies the island of
Marinduque. It is about twenty-six leagues in circumference, and eight leagues wide, and contains about one thousand men.
Capul and this island are under the charge of one encomendero. The Indians are Pintados, although under the jurisdiction of
neither &Ccedil;ubu, Arevalo, nor Camarines.


<a id="d0e4939"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4939">96</a>]</span></p>
<p class="div2"></p>
<h3>Chapter Fifth</h3>
<p><i>Which treats of the province of Ylocos</i>


</p>
<p><i>Island of Luzon, continued</i>. Going out of the bay of Manilla, and sailing north toward the province of Ylocos, first comes the province of the &Ccedil;ambales.
This province has about one thousand men, who are like the Chichimecos of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. Their customs are much like those
of the Moros; they differ from the latter in their dress. These people wear short trousers, and short-sleeved jackets shaped
to fit [the neck: <i>crossed out in MS</i>.], which resemble the <i>saltambarca</i>.<a id="d0e4957src" href="#d0e4957" class="noteref">2</a> On the middle of the breast, and on the shoulders, they wear a badge resembling a cross, fashioned in different colors. Some
of them cut only half of their hair&#8212;namely, from the brow to the crown of the head. The villages of this province which are
known are Marayomo, Pinahuyu, Mahaban, Buanguin, Tuguy, Polo, Bongalon, Dalayap, Cabatogan, and Bacol. It is the custom among
this people to punish murderers by boring a hole through the crown of the head and taking out the brains.

</p>
<p><i>Province of Bulinao</i>. Next comes Bulinao, also inhabited by &Ccedil;ambales; but the province belongs to his Majesty. It has a population of about four
hundred peaceful Indians, besides many more who live among the mountains. The latter are a warlike people, whose only delight
and satisfaction is in waging <a id="d0e4964"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4964">98</a>]</span>war and in cutting off one another&#8217;s heads, which they hang up in their houses. The man who can display the most heads in
his house is he who is most respected and feared by all. They cultivate the land although only in small tracts. They are like
the Chichimecos of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, who cannot be subdued&#8212;except that the villages of Bulinao, as I have said, contain about
four hundred Indians who are pacified. These people recognize a God in heaven; but in times of trouble and sickness they invoke
their dead and their ancestors, like the people of Visaya.

</p>
<p><i>Bay of Pangasinan</i>. About five leagues farther is the province of Pangasinan. Its bay is about six leagues around. Three large rivers, which
flow from the mining district of the mountains, fall into this bay. This province has a peaceful population of four thousand.
The land is allotted to six encomenderos; but the best portion of it, which has one thousand men, belongs to his Majesty.
The people resemble the Cambales above mentioned, in both dress and language; but they are more intelligent, for they are
traders and traffic with the Chinese, Japanese, Borneans, and the natives of other islands. This province abounds in food
supplies, such as rice, goats, and swine; and many buffaloes are hunted. The main occupation of this people is commerce; but
they are also good farmers, and sell their articles of food and clothing to the miners; the gold that they obtain in return
for these they barter with the Spaniards. The men are very jealous of their wives, whom they kill immediately if caught in
adultery; nor do the relatives of the latter resent the deed. These people, like the Pintados, kill their children if they
have many, in order that they may not live in poverty.
<a id="d0e4970"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4970">100</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Alcalde-mayor of Pangassinan</i>. For two years this district has had one alcalde-mayor, who receives a salary of one hundred pesos. From this province one
can go by land to Manilla, over a very smooth and good road, having to travel only fourteen or fifteen leagues to arrive at
the Capanpanga River.

</p>
<p><i>Port of Japon</i>. Four leagues farther is a port which is called the port of Japon. There is a settlement of [Spaniard: <i>crossed out in MS</i>.] Indians, of the same race as those of Pangasinan.

</p>
<p><i>Alinguey and Baratao</i>. Six leagues farther are the villages of Alinguey and Baratao, with a population of about two thousand. Once they were allotted
to one encomendero, but now they belong to the royal crown. The people are of the same race as those who inhabit Pangasinan.

</p>
<p><i>Purao</i>. Four leagues farther are the villages of Purao, with a population of two thousand. These towns are under the encomendero
of Bitis and Lubao. The people differ from the above in language, but resemble them in their behavior and customs. They till
the land; and possess much gold, on account of being near the mines. These people do not kill their children, as do the people
of Pangasinan.

</p>
<p><i>Villages of Lumaquaque</i>. Three leagues farther is the valley of Lumaquaque, where live about one thousand five hundred natives. Half of this district
is under one encomendero, the other half belongs to his Majesty. The people resemble those of Purao.

</p>
<p><i>Villages of Candon</i>. Two leagues farther are the villages of Candon, with a population of about one thousand eight hundred. They are under two
encomenderos. <a id="d0e4998"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e4998">102</a>]</span>The people resemble those of Purao.

</p>
<p><i>Province of Maluacan</i>. Three leagues farther is the province of Maluacan, with a population of about one thousand eight hundred. It is under the
encomendero of Bonbon.

</p>
<p><i>Valley of Landan</i>. Two leagues farther is the valley of Landan, with a population of about one thousand Indians, who belong to the hospital
of the city of Manilla.

</p>
<p><i>Village of Vigan</i>. Opposite this valley is the village of Vigan, with about eight hundred inhabitants. It belongs to his Majesty. Not far from
Vigan is settled the town of Fernandina, which Guido de la Vezaris founded in the year seventy-five. He appointed there six
regidors, two alcaldes, and one chief justice for all the provinces of the Ylocos.

</p>
<p><i>Alcalde-mayor of Ylocos</i>. At the coming of Limahon, Fernandina was plundered, and there only remains now one alcalde-mayor, with twenty or thirty
Spaniards, who usually dwell there as if in banishment. The alcalde-mayor receives a salary of three hundred pesos, and appoints
notaries at his pleasure.

</p>
<p><i>Valley of Bantay</i>. One league from this town is the valley of Bantay, with a population of about one thousand six hundred, and one encomendero.

</p>
<p><i>Valley of Sinay</i>. Three leagues farther is the valley of Sinay, which is under the same encomendero of Bantay, and has a population of about
one thousand six hundred.

</p>
<p><i>The valley of Vavo</i>. Two leagues from Sinay is the valley of Vavo. It is under one encomendero, and has a population of about one thousand Indians.

</p>
<p><i>Province of Cacaguayan</i>. Still farther is the province <a id="d0e5032"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5032">104</a>]</span>of Cacaguayan, with a population of about four thousand. Two thousand of them are under two encomenderos&#8212;each with one thousand;
and two thousand belong to his Majesty.

</p>
<p><i>Province of Ylagua.</i> Two leagues farther is the province of Ylagua, which belongs to his Majesty. It has a population of about five thousand,
but they are not all peaceful.

</p>
<p><i>Valley of Dynglas.</i> Three leagues inland from this province is a valley called Dinglas. It has a population of about two thousand Indians, and
one encomendero.

</p>
<p><i>Valley of Vicagua.</i> Farther along the coast from Ylagua is the valley of Vicagua, with a population of two thousand, and two encomiendas. This
valley is twenty leagues from the Cagayan River. There are to be found some rivers and settlements, but the inhabitants are
not pacified or even known.

</p>
<p>All the people of the Ylocos resemble the Pintados in their manner of living, but they eat raw meat. They are a quiet and
peaceful people, dislike war, and are humble and well-disposed.

</p>
<p>Thus, from the city of Manilla to the Cagayan River hither, the distance is about one hundred and ten leagues, as stated above.
On account of the shortness of the time before me, I am unable to give a more detailed account of this island of Lu&ccedil;on, which
is the most important in this land.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Mindoro.</i> Opposite the encomiendas of Bonbon and Batangas lies the island of Mindoro. The Moros form the greater part of its population.
Three leagues from the island of Lu&ccedil;on is located the village of Mindoro. This is a good harbor for ships, and belongs to
his Majesty. The village is inhabited <a id="d0e5054"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5054">106</a>]</span>by about two hundred and fifty Moros. The island is eighty leagues in circumference, and is scantily populated, for it has
in all less than five hundred inhabitants. Some blacks live in the mountains, who gather a large quantity of wax. The island
is ill supplied with provisions.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Luban</i>. Four leagues from the western point of this island, and opposite the bay of Manilla, lies the island of Luban. It is twenty
leagues from Manilla, and has a circumference of about ten leagues. It has six villages, with a total population of about
five hundred Indians.

</p>
<p>Close to this island is a smaller one by the same name, with about one hundred inhabitants. The people are the same as those
of Luzon.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Elin</i>. The island of Elin lies two leagues south from the island of Mindoro. It is seven leagues in circumference and is inhabited
by about two hundred Visayan Indians.

</p>
<p><i>Alcalde-mayor of Vindoro</i>. These islands&#8212;namely Mindoro, Elin, and Luban&#8212;are under one encomendero, and all have one alcalde-mayor, who holds jurisdiction
also over that region of Lu&ccedil;on which begins at Batangas and ends at the province of Camarines, to which region we shall now
return.

</p>
<p><i>Islands of the Babayanes</i>. Opposite the Cagayan River, in the open sea toward China, are seven islands, called Babuyanes. Because many swine are imported
therefrom into the province of Ylocos, and since the word for swine in the Ylocos language is <i>babuyes</i>, the islands have been called by that name. Of their inhabitants very little is known.

</p>
<p><i>Island of Calamianes</i>. Returning from Burney and sailing from Manilla twelve leagues beyond the <a id="d0e5081"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5081">108</a>]</span>island of Elin, we find the islands of the Calamianes. These islands being somewhat out of the way, very little is known about
them&#8212;that is, about their inhabitants, for only a few villages along the coast have been seen, where the tribute is collected.
The natives of these coast-towns are Pintados; those who live in the mountains are blacks. A very large quantity of wax is
collected there, which is an article of barter for nearly all the other islands. They lack provisions and clothing. The most
important of the Calamianes islands is Paraguan, which has a circuit of one hundred and fifty leagues. The other islands are
small, and only the following are inhabited: Tanianao, Binorboran, Cabanga, Bangaan, Caramian (which is also called by another
name, Linapacan), Dipayan, and Coron. In all these islands, only three hundred Indians pay tribute; therefore very little
is known about them. These islands are all under the jurisdiction of the alcalde-mayor of Mindoro, [and pay tribute: <i>crossed out in MS</i>.] and belong to the royal crown.


</p>
<p class="div2"></p>
<h3>Chapter Sixth</h3>
<p><i>Of the inhabitants of the Pintados Islands and their mode of life</i>


</p>
<p>The natives of the Pintados Islands are not very dark. Both men and women are well formed and have regular features. Some
of the women are white. Both men and women wear their hair long, and fastened in a knot on the crown of the head, which is
very becoming. The men tattoo their entire bodies with very beautiful figures, using therefor small <a id="d0e5095"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5095">110</a>]</span>pieces of iron dipped in ink. This ink incorporates itself with the blood, and the marks are indelible. They are healthy people,
for the climate of that land is good. Among them are found no crippled, maimed, deaf, or dumb persons. No one of them has
ever been possessed by evil spirits, or has become insane. Therefore they reach an advanced age in perfect health. The Pintados
are a courageous and warlike race; they have continually waged war on both land and sea. They bore their ears in two places
and wear beautiful ornaments, not only in their ears, but also around their necks and arms. Their dress is neat and modest,
made generally of cotton, medri&ntilde;aque, or silk (which they get from China and other places). They are greatly addicted to the
use of a kind of wine which they make from rice and from the palm-tree, and which is good. Very rarely do they become angry
when drunk, for their drunkenness passes off in jests or in sleep.

</p>
<p>The men are very fond of their wives, for it is the men who give the dowry at marriage. And even if their wives commit adultery,
action is never taken against the woman, but against the adulterer. An abominable custom among the men is to bore a hole through
the genital organ, placing within this opening a tin tube, to which they fasten a wheel like that of a spur, a full palm in
circumference. These are made of tin, and some of them weigh more than half a pound. They use twenty kinds of these wheels;
but modesty forbids us to speak of them. By means of these they have intercourse with their wives.<a id="d0e5099src" href="#d0e5099" class="noteref">3</a> The <a id="d0e5108"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5108">112</a>]</span>inhabitants of the mountains do not follow this custom; all, however, circumcise themselves, saying that they do it for their
health and for cleanliness. When they marry, they are not concerned whether their wives are virgins or not.

</p>
<p>The women are beautiful, but unchaste. They do not hesitate to commit adultery, because they receive no punishment for it.
They are well and modestly dressed, in that they cover all the private parts; they are very clean, and are very fond of perfumes.
It is considered a disgrace among them to have many children; for they say that when the property is to be divided among all
the children, they will all be poor, and that it is better to have one child, and leave him wealthy. The Pintados are very
strict as to whom they marry; for no one marries below his station. Therefore chiefs will never marry any but women of rank.
All the men are accustomed to have as many wives as they can buy and support. The women are extremely lewd, and they even
encourage their own daughters to a life of unchastity; so that there is nothing so vile for the latter that they cannot do
it before their mothers, since they incur no punishment. The men, however, are not so vile as the Moros. The Pintados love
their wives so dearly, that, in case of a quarrel they take sides with their wives&#8217; relatives, even against their own fathers
and brothers.

<a id="d0e5112"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5112">114</a>]</span></p>
<p class="div2"></p>
<h3>Chapter Seventh</h3>
<p><i>Which treats of the belief held by the natives of the Pintados islands concerning the creation</i>


</p>
<p>There are two kinds of people in this land, who, although of the same race, differ somewhat in their customs and are almost
always on mutually unfriendly terms. One class includes those who live along the coast, the other class those who live in
the mountains; and if peace seems to reign among them, it is because they depend upon each other for the necessities of life.
The inhabitants of the mountains cannot live without the fish, salt, and other articles of food, and the jars and dishes,
of other districts; nor, on the other hand, can those of the coast live without the rice and cotton of the mountaineers. In
like manner they have two different beliefs concerning the beginning of the world; and since these natives are not acquainted
with the art of writing, they preserve their ancient lore through songs, which they sing in a very pleasing manner&#8212;commonly
while plying their oars, as they are island-dwellers.

</p>
<p>Also, during their revelries, the singers who have good voices recite the exploits of olden times; thus they always possess
a knowledge of past events. The people of the coast, who are called the Yligueynes, believe that heaven and earth had no beginning,
and that there were two gods, one called Captan and the other Maguayen.<a id="d0e5124src" href="#d0e5124" class="noteref">4</a> They believe that the land breeze <a id="d0e5138"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5138">116</a>]</span>and the sea breeze were married; and that the land breeze brought forth a reed, which was planted by the god Captan. When
the reed grew, it broke into two sections, which became a man and a woman. To the man they gave the name of Sicalac, and that
is the reason why men from that time on have been called <i>lalac</i>; the woman they called Sicavay, and thenceforth women have been called <i>babayes</i>. One day the man asked the woman to marry him, for there were no other people in the world; but she refused, saying that
they were brother and sister, born of the same reed, with only one knot between them; and that she would not marry him, since
he was her brother. Finally they agreed to ask advice from the tunnies of the sea, and from the doves of the air; they also
went to the earthquake, who said that it was necessary for them to marry, so that the world might be peopled. They married,
and called their first son Sibo; then a daughter was born to them, and they gave her the name of Samar. This brother and sister
also had a daughter, called Lupluban. She married Pandaguan, a son of the first pair, and had a son called Anoranor. Pandaguan
was the first to invent a net for fishing at sea; and, the first time when he used it, he caught a shark and brought it on
shore, thinking that it would not die. But the shark died when brought ashore; and Pandaguan, when he saw this, began to mourn
and weep over it&#8212;complaining against the gods for having allowed the shark to die, when no one had died before that time.
It is said that the god Captan, on hearing this, sent the <a id="d0e5146"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5146">118</a>]</span>flies to ascertain who the dead one was; but, as the flies did not dare to go, Captan sent the weevil, who brought back the
news of the shark&#8217;s death. The god Captan was displeased at these obsequies to a fish. He and Maguayen made a thunderbolt,
with which they killed Pandaguan; he remained thirty days in the infernal regions, at the end of which time the gods took
pity upon him, brought him back to life, and returned him to the world. While Pandaguan was dead, his wife Lubluban became
the concubine of a man called Maracoyrun; and these people say that at that time concubinage began in the world. When Pandaguan
returned, he did not find his wife at home, because she had been invited by her friend to feast upon a pig that he had stolen;
and the natives say that this was the first theft committed in the world. Pandaguan sent his son for Lubluban, but she refused
to go home, saying that the dead do not return to the world. At this answer Pandaguan became angry, and returned to the infernal
regions. The people believe that, if his wife had obeyed his summons, and he had not gone back at that time, all the dead
would return to life. [<i>Blank space in MS</i>.] Inheritances, and their inventor. Their ceremonies. The omentum<a id="d0e5151src" href="#d0e5151" class="noteref">5</a>.


</p>
<p><i>Another belief, that of the mountaineers, who are called Tinguianes</i>

</p>
<p>The Tinguianes believe that in the beginning were only the sea and the sky; and that one day a kite, having no place where
to alight, determined to set the sea against the sky. Accordingly, the sea declared <a id="d0e5160"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5160">120</a>]</span>war against the sky, and threw her waters upward. The sky, seeing this, made a treaty of peace with the sea. Afterward, to
avenge himself upon her for having dared to assert herself, they say that he showered upon the sea all the islands of this
archipelago, in order to subdue her; and that the sea ran to and fro without being able to rise again. They say that from
this event arose the custom of <i>mavaris</i>&#8212;that is, taking vengeance for an insult received, a very common practice in this land; and they consider it a point of honor
to take revenge. Then they relate also the story of the reed; but they say that the kite pecked the reed, and the aforesaid
man and woman came out. They add that the first time when Cavahi gave birth to children, she brought forth a great number
at once. One day the father went home, very angry, and threatened the children. The latter were frightened and fled; some
into the most hidden rooms of the house; some hid in other places nearer the open air; some hid themselves within the <i>dindines</i>, or walls of the houses, which are constructed of reeds; some in the fireplace; and some fled to the sea through the same
door by which the father had entered. It is said that those who fled to the most hidden rooms are the chiefs of these islands;
those who remained nearer the outside are the timaguas; those who hid themselves within the walls are the slaves; those who
hid themselves in the fireplace are the blacks; and those who fled out to the sea through the open door, are the Spaniards,
and that they had no news of us until they beheld us return through the sea.

<p class="div2"></p>
<h3>Chapter Eighth</h3>
<p><i>Of their belief concerning the dead</i>


</p>
<p>It is said that the souls of those who are stabbed to death, eaten by crocodiles, or killed by arrows (which is considered
a very honorable death), go to heaven by way of the arch which is formed when it rains, and become gods. The souls of the
drowned remain in the sea forever. By way of honor to these, they erect a tall reed and hang upon it a garment&#8212;that of a man,
if the dead be a man; but a woman&#8217;s, for a woman. This garment is left there until it falls to pieces through age. When the
children or other relatives of drowned persons are sick, the relatives are taken and placed in a barangay, in company with
a <i>baylana</i>, who is a sort of priestess; and, at the place indicated by the priestess, they throw into the sea a chest filled with robes
and other articles, which they have brought with them. At the same time their ancestors are invoked to protect and help the
sick man during his illness.


</p>
<p><i>Belief regarding the dead</i>

</p>
<p>If those who die from disease are young, the Pintados say that the <i>mangalos</i>, who are goblins, are eating their bowels, wherefore they die; for these people do not know that the corruption of humors
causes diseases. They say of those who die in old age that the wind comes and snatches away their souls. And of those who
die thus, the Arayas (which is a certain <a id="d0e5190"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5190">124</a>]</span>alliance of villages), they say, go to a very high mountain in the island of Panay, called Mayas. The souls of the Yligueynes,
who comprise the people of &Ccedil;ubu, Bohol, and Bantay, go with the god called Sisiburanen, to a very high mountain in the island
of Burney.

</p>
<p><i>The god Sidapa</i>. They say that there is in the sky another god, called Sidapa. This god possesses a very tall tree on mount Mayas. There
he measures the lives of all the new-born, and places a mark on the tree; when the person&#8217;s stature equals this mark, he dies
immediately.

</p>
<p><i>Belief concerning the destination of souls</i>. It is believed that at death all souls go directly to the infernal regions; but that, by means of the <i>maganitos</i>, which are the sacrifices and offerings made to the god Pandaque in sight of the mount of Mayas, they are redeemed from Simuran
and Siguinarugan, gods of the lower regions.

</p>
<p>It is said that, when the Yligueynes die, the god Maguayen carries them to Inferno. When he has carried them thither in his
barangay, Sumpoy, another god, sallies forth, takes them away, and leads them to Sisiburanen, the god before mentioned, who
keeps them all. Good or bad alike, he takes them all on equal terms, when they go to Inferno. But the poor, who have no one
to offer sacrifices for them, remain forever, in the inferno, and the god of those regions eats them, or keeps them forever
in prison. From this it will be seen how little their being good or bad avails them, and how much reason they have to hate
poverty.

</p>
<p><i>Baylanas</i>. The natives of these islands have neither time nor place set apart for the offering of prayers and sacrifices to their gods.
It is only in case <a id="d0e5209"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5209">126</a>]</span>of sickness, and in times of seed-sowing or of war, that sacrifices are offered. These sacrifices are called <i>baylanes</i>, and the priestesses, or the men who perform this office, are also called <i>baylanes</i>. The priestesses dress very gaily, with garlands on their heads, and are resplendent with gold. They bring to the place of
sacrifice some <i>pitarrillas</i> (a kind of earthen jar) full of rice-wine, besides a live hog and a quantity of prepared food. Then the priestess chants
her songs and invokes the demon, who appears to her all glistening in gold. Then he enters her body and hurls her to the ground,
foaming at the mouth as one possessed. In this state she declares whether the sick person is to recover or not. In regard
to other matters, she foretells the future. All this takes place to the sound of bells and kettle-drums. Then she rises and
taking a spear, she pierces the heart of the hog. They dress it and prepare a dish for the demons. Upon an altar erected there,
they place the dressed hog, rice, bananas, wine, and all the other articles of food that they have brought. All this is done
in behalf of sick persons, or to redeem those who are confined in the infernal regions. When they go to war or on a plundering
expedition, they offer prayers to Varangao, who is the rainbow, and to their gods, Ynaguinid and Macanduc. For the redemption
of souls detained in the inferno above mentioned, they invoke also their ancestors, and the dead, claiming to see them and
receive answers to their questions.

</p>
<p><i>Belief concerning the world. The god Macaptan.</i> They believe that the world has no end. They say that Macaptan dwells highest in the sky. They consider him a bad god, because
he sends disease and death among them, saying that because he has not <a id="d0e5224"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5224">128</a>]</span>eaten anything of this world, or drunk any pitarrillas, he does not love them, and so kills them.

</p>
<p><i>The god Lalahon</i>. It is said that the divinity Lalahon dwells in a volcano in Negros island, whence she hurls fire. The volcano is about five
leagues from the town of Arevalo. They invoke Lalahon for their harvest; when she does not choose to grant them good harvests
she sends the locusts to destroy and consume the crops. This Lalahon is a woman.

</p>
<p><i>Burials</i>. These natives bury their dead in certain wooden coffins, in their own houses. They bury with the dead gold, cloth, and other
valuable objects&#8212;saying that if they depart rich they will be well received in the other world, but coldly if they go poor.

</p>
<p><i>How they guard the dead</i>. When anyone dies, the people light many fires near his house; and at night armed men go to act as sentinels about his coffin,
for fear that the sorcerers (who are in this country also) may come and touch the coffin; for then the coffin would immediately
burst open and a great stench issue from the corpse, which could not any longer remain in the coffin. For this reason they
keep watch for several nights.

</p>
<p><i>Slaves killed at the death of chiefs</i>. When any chief descended from Dumaguet dies, a slave is made to die by the same death as that of the chief. They choose
the most wretched slave whom they can find, so that he may serve the chief in the other world. They always select for this
a slave who is a foreigner, and not a native; for they really are not at all cruel. They say that the reason for their killing
slaves, as we have said, at the death of any chief is very ancient. According to their story, a chief called Marapan more
than ten thousand years ago, while easing his <a id="d0e5242"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5242">130</a>]</span>body asked a slave of his for some grass with which to clean himself. The slave threw to him a large stalk of reed-grass,
which seems to have hit the chief on the knee, causing a wound. As he was at the time a very old man, he died, as they say,
from the blow; but before his death he gave orders that, when he should die, the slave and all his children should be put
to death. From this arose the custom of killing slaves at the death of a chief.

</p>
<p><i>Mourning indicated by fasting</i>. When the father or mother or any near relative died, they promised to eat no rice until they should seize some captive in
battle. The actual sign of mourning among them was the wearing of armlets made of bejucos [rattans] which covered the entire
arm, with a similar band around the neck. They drank no pitarrilla, and their only food was bananas and camotes, until they
had either taken a captive or killed some one, when they ceased their mourning; it might thus happen that they would eat no
rice for a whole year, and therefore they would be, at the end of that period, very languid and weak. Sometimes a man determined,
soon after a relative&#8217;s death, to eat nothing, but to abandon himself to death. But his timaguas and slaves quickly assembled,
and made a collection throughout the village; bananas were given him for food, and <i>tuba</i> (which is a wine made from the palm-tree) for drink, so that he should not die. These gains were the perquisites of the chiefs.
This kind of mourning is called among them <i>maglahe</i>.

</p>
<p><i>Mourning among the women</i>. The mourning observed by the women they call <i>morotal</i>. It is similar to that of the men, except that the mourner&#8212;instead of going to capture or kill some one before she is <a id="d0e5261"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5261">132</a>]</span>allowed to cease mourning and to eat rice again&#8212;embarks in a barangay with many women; they have one Indian man to steer,
one to bail, and one in the bow. These three Indians are always chosen as being very valiant men, who have achieved much success
in war. Thus they go to a village of their friends, the three Indians singing all along the way, keeping time with their oars;
they recount their exploits, the slaves whom they have captured, and the men whom they have killed in war. The vessel is laden
with wine and pitarrillas. When they reach the village, they exchange invitations with the inhabitants, and hold a great revel.
After this they lay aside their white robes, and strip the bejuco bands from their arms and necks; the mourning ends, and
they begin to eat rice again, and to adorn themselves with gold.

</p>
<p><i>Larao of the dead</i>&#8212;<i>that is, mourning</i>. One of the observances which is carried out with most rigor is that called <i>larao</i>. This rule requires that when a chief dies all must mourn him, and must observe the following restrictions: No one shall
quarrel with any other during the time of mourning, and especially at the time of the burial. Spears must be carried point
downward, and daggers be carried in the belt with hilt reversed. No gala or colored dress shall be worn during that time.
There must be no singing on board a barangay when returning to the village, but strict silence is maintained. They make an
enclosure around the house of the dead man; and if anyone, great or small, passes by and transgresses this bound, he shall
be punished. In order that all men may know of a chief&#8217;s death and no one feign ignorance, one of the timaguas who is held
in honor goes through the village and makes announcement of <a id="d0e5273"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5273">134</a>]</span>the mourning. He who transgresses the law must pay the penalty, without fail. If he who does this wrong be a slave&#8212;one of
those who serve without the dwelling&#8212;and has not the means to pay, his owner pays for him; but the latter takes the slave
to his own house, that he may serve him, and makes him an ayoey. They say that these rules were left to them by Lubluban and
Panas. To some, especially to the religious, it has seemed as if they were too rigorous for these people; but they were general
among chiefs, timaguas, and slaves.

</p>
<p><i>Wars</i>. The first man who waged war, according to their story, was Panas, the son of that Anoranor, who was grandson of the first
human [parents: <i>crossed out in MS</i>.] beings. He declared war against Ma&ntilde;garan, on account of an inheritance; and from that time date the first wars, because
the people were divided into two factions, and hostility was handed down from father to son. They say that Panas was the first
man to use weapons in fighting.

</p>
<p><i>Just wars</i>. There are three cases in which these natives regard war as just. The first is when an Indian goes to another village and
is there put to death without cause; the second, when their wives are stolen from them; and the third is when they go in friendly
manner to trade at any village, and there, under the appearance of friendship, are wronged or maltreated.

</p>
<p><i>Laws</i>. They say that the laws by which they have thus far been governed were left to them by Lubluban, the woman whom we have already
mentioned. Of these laws only the chiefs are defenders and executors There are no judges, although there are mediators who
go from one party to another to bring about a reconciliation.

<p class="div2"></p>
<h3>Chapter Ninth</h3>
<p><i>Which treats of slavery in the Filipinas Islands</i>


</p>
<p><i>Laws of slavery</i>. No Indian in this country is made a slave or is put to death for any crime which he commits, even if it be theft, adultery,
or murder&#8212;except that for each crime there is an established fine, which they have to pay in jewels or gold, and if the culprit
is unable to pay the fine he will borrow the money, and pledge himself to the man from whom he borrows. As a result he becomes
a slave, until he shall repay what was lent to him; after that, he is free again. Therefore, according to the crime committed,
they are slaves; and there are three classes of slaves in these islands. The first, and the most thoroughly enslaved, is the
bondman of him who is served in his own dwelling; such a slave they call <i>ayuey</i>. These slaves work three days for the master, and one for themselves.

</p>
<p><i>Kinds of slavery</i>. Another class of slaves are those called <i>tumaranpoc</i>. They live in their own houses, and are obliged to go to work for their master one day out of four, having the three days
for themselves. If they fail to work for their master, in order to cultivate their own fields, they give the master each year
ten <i>&ccedil;hicubites</i> of rice, each &ccedil;hicubite being equal to one fan&eacute;ga.

</p>
<p>There are other slaves, whom these people hold in most respect, who are called <i>tomatabans</i>; these work in the house of the master only when there is some <a id="d0e5320"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5320">138</a>]</span>banquet or revel. On such occasions they bring small gifts, and share in the drinking. But when one of these slaves dies,
the property left by the slave is shared with his children by the master. During their lifetime, these slaves are bound to
work for their master five days in a month; or, if they do not work, they annually give the master five &ccedil;hicubites of rice.

</p>
<p><i>Value of the slaves</i>. The ayueys are worth among these people two gold taes of Labin sian, the equivalent of twelve pesos. The tumaranpoques are
worth the same sum. The tumatabans are worth one tae, or six pesos.

</p>
<p>The ayuey women, like their husbands, work in the houses of chiefs. The tumaranpoque women, if they have children, serve half
of the month in spinning and weaving cotton, which their masters supply; and during the other half of the month they work
for themselves. The tumataban women spin only one hank of cotton each month for their masters, who furnish to them the cotton
in the boll. Only the ayueys receive food and clothing from their masters; to the others the masters give nothing. When these
slaves die the masters take away all their property, except from the tomatabans, as we have said above. Those whom these natives
have sold as slaves to the Spaniards are mostly the ayueys.

</p>
<p>The rules which they observe for punishing any one so severely as to enslave him are as follows: for murder, adultery, and
theft; and for insulting any woman of rank, or taking away her robe in public and leaving her naked, or causing her to flee
or defend herself so that it falls off, which is considered a great offense.

</p>
<p><i>Thieves</i>. If a thief commit a great robbery, he <a id="d0e5334"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5334">140</a>]</span>and all his relatives (or at least his nearest kin) are fined. If they are unable to pay the fine, they are made slaves. This
law applies to all classes, and even to the chiefs themselves; accordingly, if a chief commit any crime, even against one
of his own slaves or timaguas, he is fined in the same manner. But they are not reduced to slavery for lack of means to pay
the fine; as, if they were not chiefs, they would be slaves. In case of a small theft, the punishment falls upon the thief
alone, and not on his relatives.

</p>
<p><i>In time of famine.</i> When there is a famine the poor, who have not the means of sustenance, in order not to perish, go to the rich&#8212;and almost
always they seek their relatives and surrender themselves to them as slaves&#8212;in order to be fed.

</p>
<p><i>Another kind of slavery.</i> There is another kind of lordship [slavery: <i>crossed out in MS</i>.], which was first introduced by a man whom they call Sidumaguer&#8212;which, they say, occurred more than two thousand years ago.
Because some men broke a barangay belonging to him&#8212;in Languiguey, his native village, situated in the island of Bantayan&#8212;he
compelled the descendants of those who had broken his barangay to bequeath to him at their deaths two slaves out of every
ten, and the same portion of all their other property. This kind of slavery gradually made its way among all the Indians living
on the coast, but not among the Tinguianes.

</p>
<p><i>Real timaguas.</i> The freemen of these islands, who are called timaguas, are neither chiefs nor slaves. This is their mode of life. If a timagua
desires to live in a certain village, he joins himself to one of the chiefs&#8212;for each village usually has many chiefs, each
of whom has his own district, with slaves and timaguas, <a id="d0e5351"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5351">142</a>]</span>well known to him&#8212;to whom he offers himself as his timagua, binding himself to observe the following laws: When feasts are
given to other chiefs he must attend; for it is the custom that the timagua drink first from the pitarrilla, before any chief
does so. He must, with his weapons, accompany the chief when he goes on a journey. When the latter enters a boat the timagua
must go to ply the oar, and to carry his weapons for the defense of the vessel; but if the vessel sustain any damages he receives
no punishment for this, but is only reprimanded. For this service the chief is under obligation to defend the timagua, in
his own person and those of his relatives, against anyone who seeks to injure him without cause; and thus it happens that,
to defend the timaguas, fathers fight against their sons, and brothers against one another. If the timagua goes to any other
village and there is wronged, the chief will endeavor, with all his forces, to avenge him to the same extent. Thus the timaguas
live in security, and are free to pass from the service of one chief to that of another, whenever they so desire, and without
any obstacle being placed in their way.

</p>
<p><i>Of the manner in which they set out on raids</i>. These natives have a method of casting lots with the teeth of a crocodile or of a wild boar. During the ceremony they invoke
their gods and their ancestors, and inquire of them as to the result of their wars and their journeys. By knots or loops which
they make with cords, they foretell what will happen to them; and they resort to these practices for everything which they
have to undertake. The Indians along the coast are accustomed to set out every year on their plundering expeditions in the
season of the bonan&ccedil;as, <a id="d0e5357"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5357">144</a>]</span>which come between the brisas and the vendabals. The Tinguianes set out after they have gathered their harvests; and since
their custom is to be enemies to those who are such to their friends, they do not lack opportunity for fighting.

</p>
<p>While on a plundering expedition, if they could take their enemy alive they did not kill him. If any one slew a captive after
his surrender, he must pay for him with his own money; and if he were unable to do so he was held as a slave. The booty that
they take, whatever it may be, belongs to the chiefs, except a small portion which is given to the timaguas who go with them
as oarsmen. But if many chiefs went on a raid, the one who offered the <i>magaanito,</i> or the sacrifice mentioned above, received half of the booty, and the other half belonged to the other chiefs.

</p>
<p><i>Captured chiefs.</i> If any chief were taken captive, he was well treated; and if any friend ransomed the captive because he was far from home,
the captive returned to him double the amount that his friend had paid for him, because of his good offices in withdrawing
the chief from captivity; for the latter would, otherwise, always remain a prisoner. When a chief was taken captive, or committed
adultery or murder, all his relatives contributed toward his ransom, each according to the degree of his kinship; and if the
relatives had not means to do this the chief remained a slave.

</p>
<p><i>Borrowing.</i> If they lent rice to anyone, one year was allowed for repaying it, since it is something that is planted. If the loan were
not repaid after the first harvest, double the amount was to be paid at the second; at the third harvest, fourfold was due
on an unpaid loan; and so on, regularly increasing. This was <a id="d0e5372"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5372">146</a>]</span>the only usury among them, although some have stated otherwise; but those persons were not well informed. Now, some who are
lazy, and unwilling to exert themselves to pay the tribute, ask a loan for this purpose, and repay a somewhat larger sum.

</p>
<p><i>Inheritances.</i> It is their custom to share inheritances in the following manner. If a man died and left four children, the property and
the slaves were divided into four equal parts, and each one of the children took his own share. If the dead man left a bastard
child, the latter would receive only what the brothers were pleased to give him; for he had no right to one of the shares,
nor could he take more than what his brothers voluntarily gave him, or the legacy made by his father in his favor. If the
father chose to favor any of his children in his will, he did so. If the dead man left no children, all his brothers inherited
his property, having equal shares therein; and if he had no brothers, his cousins-german would inherit; if he had no cousins,
all his kinsmen. His property, then, went to the children, if he had any; if not, his brothers were necessarily the heirs;
if he had no brothers, his first cousins; and in default of these, all his relatives shared the estate equally.



</p>
<p class="div2"></p>
<h3>Chapter Tenth</h3>
<p><i>Which treats of marriage customs in these islands</i>


</p>
<p><i>Marriage of the chiefs.</i> Great mistakes have been made regarding the marriages formed among the natives of this country since they have become Christians,
because the marriage customs once observed among the natives have not been clearly understood. <a id="d0e5389"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5389">148</a>]</span>Therefore some religious join them in marriage, while others release them, and others re&euml;stablish the marriage, thus creating
great confusion. For this reason, I have diligently endeavored to bring to light the way in which they observed the marriage
ceremonies, which are as follows. When any man wishes to marry, he, since the man always asks the woman, calls in certain
timaguas who are respected in the village. (This is what the chiefs do. For there appear to be three ranks of men in these
islands&#8212;namely, chiefs, timaguas, who are freemen, and slaves&#8212;each class having different marriage customs.) The chiefs, then,
I say, send as go-betweens some of their timaguas, to negotiate the marriage. One of these men takes the young man&#8217;s lance
from his father, and when he reaches the house of the girl&#8217;s father he thrusts the spear into the staircase of the house;
and while he holds the lance thus, they invoke their gods and ancestors, requesting them to be propitious to this marriage.
If the marriage takes place, the lance belongs to the go-between, or it is redeemed.

</p>
<p>After the marriage is agreed upon&#8212;that is to say, after fixing the amount of the dowry which the husband pays to the wife
(which among the chiefs of these islands is generally the sum of one hundred taes, in gold, slaves, and jewels, and is equivalent
to one hundred pesos)&#8212;they go to bring the bride from the house of her parents. One of the Indians takes her on his shoulders;
and on arriving at the foot of the stairway to the bridegroom&#8217;s house, she affects coyness, and says that she will not enter.
When many entreaties have proved useless, the father-in-law comes out and promises to give her a slave if she will go up.
She mounts the staircase, for the slave; but <a id="d0e5393"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5393">150</a>]</span>when she reaches the top of the stairway and looks into her father-in-law&#8217;s house and sees the people assembled within, she
again pretends to be bashful, and the father-in-law must give her another slave. After she has entered, the same thing takes
place; and he must give her a jewel to make her sit down, another to make her begin to eat, and another before she will drink.
While the betrothed pair are drinking together an old man rises, and in a loud voice calls all to silence, as he wishes to
speak. He says: &#8220;So-and-so marries so-and-so, but on the condition that if the man should through dissolute conduct fail to
support his wife, she will leave him, and shall not be obliged to return anything of the dowry that he has given her; and
she shall have freedom and permission to marry another man. And therefore, should the woman betray her husband, he can take
away the dowry that he gave her, leave her, and marry another woman. Be all of you witnesses for me to this compact.&#8221; When
the old man has ended his speech, they take a dish filled with clean, uncooked rice, and an old woman comes and joins the
hands of the pair, and lays them upon the rice. Then, holding their hands thus joined, she throws the rice over all those
who are present at the banquet. Then the old woman gives a loud shout, and all answer her with a similar shout; and the marriage
contract or ceremony is completed. Up to this time, her parents do not allow the young couple to eat or sleep together; but
by performing this ceremony they deliver her up as his wife. But if, after the marriage contract has been negotiated by a
third party, the man who seeks marriage should repent of the bargain and seek to marry another woman, he loses the <a id="d0e5395"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5395">152</a>]</span>earnest-money that he has given, even if he has had no intercourse with the former; because when they commence negotiations
for the marriage they begin to give the dowry. If a man say in conversation, or at a drunken feast, &#8220;I wish to marry so-and-so,
daughter of so-and-so,&#8221; and afterward break his promise and refuse to marry her, he is fined for it; and they take away a
great part of his property.

</p>
<p>In regard to the dowry, neither the husband nor the wife can enjoy it until they have children; for until then it belongs
to the father-in-law. If the bridegroom is not of age to marry, or the bride is too young, both still work in the house of
the father-in-law until they are of age to live together.

</p>
<p><i>Marriage among the timaguas</i>. The timaguas do not follow these usages, because they have no property of their own. They do not observe the ceremony of
joining hands over the dish of rice, through respect for the chiefs; for that ceremony is for chiefs only. Their marriage
is accomplished when the pair unite in drinking pitarrilla from the same cup. Then they give a shout, and all the guests depart;
and they are considered as married, for they are not allowed to drink together until late at night. The same ceremony is observed
by rich and respectable slaves.

</p>
<p><i>Marriage among the slaves</i>. But the poor slaves, who serve in the houses, marry each other without drinking and without any go-between. They observe
no ceremony, but simply say to each other, &#8220;Let us marry.&#8221; If a chief have a slave, one of his ayoiys, who serves in the house,
and wishes to marry him to a female slave of the same class belonging to another chief, he sends an Indian woman as agent
to the master of the female slave, saying that her master <a id="d0e5407"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5407">154</a>]</span>wishes to marry one of his male slaves to the other&#8217;s female slave. After the marriage has been arranged, he gives his slave
an earthen jar, or three or four dishes, and there is no other ceremony. Half of the children born to this couple will belong
to the master of the female slave, and the other half will belong to the master of the male slave. When the time comes when
their children are able to work for their masters, the parents are made tumaranpoques, as we have said; because when a male
slave of one chief marries the female slave of another chief, they immediately receive a house for their own use, and go out
to work for their masters. If a freeman marries a female slave, or <i>vice versa</i>, half of the children are slaves. Thus, if there are two children, one is free and the other a slave, as the parents may
choose.

</p>
<p>In one thing these natives seem to go beyond all reason and justice. It is usage among them that, if an Indian of one village
owes twenty pesos (to suppose a case) to an Indian in another village, and when asked for the money refuses to repay it, when
any Indian of that village where the said twenty pesos is due is caught, they seize him&#8212;even if he is in no way related to
or acquainted with the debtor&#8212;and compel him to pay the twenty pesos. It is their custom that he who first owed the twenty
pesos must return to him who paid that sum forty pesos instead, on account of the violence used against him. They say that
they act thus in order not to use the mailed hand for collecting from the other in that village, since that would result in
war.

</p>
<p><i>Friendship</i>. Reconciliation between those who have quarreled, whether these are individuals or the people of different villages, is brought
about by <a id="d0e5418"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5418">156</a>]</span>drawing blood from the arms of both parties, and each tasting the blood of the other, placed in a shell, sometimes mixed with
a little wine; and such friendship is not to be broken.

</p>
<p><i>Witches and sorcerers; physicians</i>. In this land are sorcerers and witches&#8212;although there are also good physicians, who cure diseases with medicinal herbs;
especially they have a remedy for every kind of poison, for there are most wonderful antidotal herbs. The natives of this
island are very superstitious; consequently, no native will embark for any voyage in a vessel on which there may be a goat
or a monkey, for they say that they will surely be wrecked. They have a thousand other omens of this sort. For a few years
past they have had among them one form of witchcraft which was invented by the natives of Ybalon after the Spaniards had come
here. This is the invocation of certain demons, whom they call Naguined, Arapayan, and Macbarubac. To these they offer sacrifices,
consisting of cocoanut-oil and a crocodile&#8217;s tooth; and while they make these offerings, they invoke the demons. This oil
they sell to one another; and even when they sell it they offer sacrifices and invoke the demon, beseeching him that the power
which he possesses may be transferred to the buyer of the oil. They claim that the simple declaration that one will die within
a certain time is sufficient to make him die immediately at that time, unless they save him with another oil, which counteracts
the former. This witchery has done a great deal of harm among the Pintados, because the demon plays tricks on them. The religious
have tried to remedy this evil, by taking away from them the oil and chastising them.
<a id="d0e5424"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5424">158</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Sneezing</i>. If any one who is going to war or is about to begin any important undertaking, sneeze on leaving the house, he considers
it a bad omen, and turns back.

</p>
<p><i>Feasts</i>. These natives have no feasts that they observe, throughout the year-save that when the married men go to war, during their
absence the women do not work.

</p>
<p><i>At the rice-harvest.</i> Besides these times they set apart seven days when they begin to till their fields, in which time they neither grind any
rice for their food, nor do they allow any stranger, during all that time, to enter their villages; for they say that that
is the time when they pray to their gods to grant them an abundant harvest.

</p>
<p><i>Years and months</i>. They divide the year into twelve months, although only seven [<i>sc</i>. eight] of these have names; they are lunar months, because they are reckoned by moons. The first month is that in which
the Pleiades appear, which they call Ulalen. The second is called Dagancahuy, the time when the trees are felled in order
to sow the land. Another month they call Daganenan bulan; it comes when the wood of those trees is collected from the fields.
Another is called Elquilin, and is the time when they burn over the fields. Another month they call Ynabuyan, which comes
when the bonan&ccedil;as blow. Another they call Cavay; it is when they weed their fields. Another they call [Cabuy: <i>crossed out in MS.</i>] Yrarapun; it is the time when they begin to harvest the rice. Another they call Manalulsul, in which the harvesting is completed.
As for the remaining months, they pay little attention to them, because in those months there is no work in the fields.
<a id="d0e5447"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5447">160</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Winds</i>. It is their opinion that the winds come from the sea, which they base on the fact that the sea swells before the winds begin
to blow.

</p>
<p><i>Turtles</i>. In this land are very many turtles, of great size; they are larger than a shield. Here is a marvellous thing when the male
and the female have intercourse, they remain thus joined together for twenty or twenty-five days. They become so stupefied
during this act that the Indians dive into the sea, and tie the feet of the turtles without their perceiving it, and draw
these creatures ashore. I have even done this myself.

</p>
<p><i>Serpents</i>. There are in this land enormous serpents, as large as palm-trees; they are, however, sluggish.

</p>
<p><i>Crocodiles</i>. There are enormous numbers of crocodiles, which are water-lizards. They live in all the rivers and in the sea, and do much
harm.

</p>
<p><i>Civet-cats.</i> In many of these islands are civet-cats.

</p>
<p><i>Tabon birds</i>. In this land there is a kind of bird, smaller than a Castilian fowl; its eggs is larger than that of a goose, and is almost
all yolk. This bird lays its eggs in the sand, a braza deep, at the edge of the water. There the young ones are hatched, and
come up through the sand, opening a way through it with their little feet; and as soon as they gain the surface they fly away.<a id="d0e5472src" href="#d0e5472" class="noteref">6</a>

</p>
<p><i>Palms</i>. In all these islands are great numbers of <a id="d0e5485"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5485">162</a>]</span>cocoa-palms. In some of the nuts are found stones as large as filberts, which the natives prize, although thus far it is not
known what efficacy they have. They draw a great quantity of wine from the palm-trees; one Indian can in one forenoon obtain
two arrobas of sap from the palm trees that he cultivates. It is sweet and good, and is used in making great quantities of
brandy, excellent vinegar, and delicious honey. The cocoanuts furnish a nutritious food when rice is scarce. From the nut-shells
they make dishes, and [from the fibrous husk?] match-cords for their arquebuses; and with the leaves they make baskets. Consequently
this tree is very useful.

</p>
<p>In these islands are very many swine, and goats of excellent quality. There are also a great many wild buffaloes, which, if
caught when young, can be easily tamed. There are ducks, and some geese which have been brought from China. There are also
a great many fowls of excellent quality, which are similar to those of Castilla. There are some fowls which have no tails,
for which reason the natives superstitiously refuse to eat them; but these are better than the other sorts.

</p>
<p>As for fruits like those in Castilla, they were formerly not to be found in this land, because of its proximity to China,
where there are so many fruits peculiar to that country. There are here some tolerably good fruits, such as excellent bananas<a id="d0e5491src" href="#d0e5491" class="noteref">7</a>; nancas, <a id="d0e5515"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5515">164</a>]</span>a very fragrant fruit, and larger than the largest Spanish melon; macupas, which resemble apples; and santors, which taste
like the quince. There are also many good oranges and lemons.

</p>
<p>In the province of Ylocos is found a large tree whose blossoms resemble the white lily, and taste like fish. The Indians gather
the blossoms in the morning, cook them, and eat them in place of fish. And, wonderful to relate, on the next morning the tree
is again full of blossoms; and this occurs day after day.

</p>
<p>In the mountain region, where there is scarcity of water, are found certain bejucos, six or eight brazas high, and larger
around than the thumb. When this stem is cut, there gushes forth a great quantity of water, of excellent taste; and this liquid
supplies the lack of water. Each bejuco will yield two or three cuartillos of water.<a id="d0e5521src" href="#d0e5521" class="noteref">8</a>

<p class="div2"></p>
<h3>Chapter Eleventh</h3>
<p><i>Which treats of the rites and ceremonies observed by the Moros in the vicinity of Manilla, and of their social conditions</i>


</p>
<p><i>The god Batala</i>. According to the religion formerly observed by these Moros, they worshiped a deity called among them Batala, which properly
means &#8220;God.&#8221; They said that they adored this Batala because he was the Lord of all, and had created <a id="d0e5544"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5544">166</a>]</span>human beings and villages. They said that this Batala had many agents under him, whom he sent to this world to produce, in
behalf of men, what is yielded here. These beings were called <i>anitos</i>, and each anito had a special office. Some of them were for the fields, and some for those who journey by sea; some for those
who went to war, and some for diseases. Each anito was therefore named for his office; there was, for instance, the anito
of the fields, and the anito of the rain. To these anitos the people offered sacrifices, when they desired anything&#8212;to each
one according to his office. The mode of sacrifice was like that of the Pintados. They summoned a <i>catalonan</i>, which is the same as the vaylan among the Pintados, that is, a priest. He offered the sacrifice, requesting from the anito
whatever the people desired him to ask, and heaping up great quantities of rice, meat, and fish. His invocations lasted until
the demon entered his body, when the catalonan fell into a swoon, foaming at the mouth. The Indians sang, drank, and feasted
until the catalonan came to himself, and told them the answer that the anito had given to him. If the sacrifice was in behalf
of a sick person, they offered many golden chains and ornaments, saying that they were paying a ransom for the sick person&#8217;s
health. This invocation of the anito continued as long as the sickness lasted.

</p>
<p>When the natives were asked why the sacrifices were offered to the anito, and not to the Batala, they answered that the Batala
was a great lord, and no one could speak to him. He lived in the sky; but the anito, who was of such a nature that he came
down here to talk with men, was to the Batala as a minister, and interceded for them. In some places and especially <a id="d0e5554"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5554">168</a>]</span>in the mountain districts, when the father, mother, or other relative dies, the people unite in making a small wooden idol,
and preserve it. Accordingly there is a house which contains one hundred or two hundred of these idols. These images also
are called <i>anitos</i>; for they say that when people die, they go to serve the Batala. Therefore they make sacrifices to these anitos, offering
them food, wine, and gold ornaments; and request them to be intercessors for them before the Batala, whom they regard as God.

</p>
<p><i>Government of the Moros</i>. Among the Moros there is precisely the same lack of government as among the Pintados. They had chiefs in their respective
districts, whom the people obeyed; they punished criminals, and laid down the laws that must be observed. In the villages,
where they had ten or twelve chiefs, one only&#8212;the richest of them&#8212;was he whom all obeyed. They greatly esteem an ancient lineage,
which is therefore a great advantage to him who desires to be a lord. When laws were to be enacted for governing the commonwealth,
the greatest chief, whom all the rest obeyed, assembled in his own house all the other chiefs of the village; and when they
had come, he made a speech, declaring that, to correct the many criminal acts which were being committed, it was necessary
that they impose penalties and enact ordinances, so that these evils might be remedied and that all might live in peace. This
policy was not in vogue among the Pintados, because no one of them was willing to recognize another as his superior. Then
the other chiefs replied that this seemed good to them; and that, since he was the greatest chief of all, he might do whatever
<a id="d0e5563"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5563">170</a>]</span>appeared to him just, and they would approve it. Accordingly, that chief made such regulations as he deemed necessary; for
these Moros possess the art of writing, which no other natives of the islands have. The other chiefs approved what he ordained.
Immediately came a public crier, whom they call <i>umalahocan</i>, who is properly a mayor-domo, or steward; he took a bell and went through the village, announcing in each district the regulations
which had been made. The people replied that they would obey. Thus the umalahocan went from village to village, through the
whole district of this chief; and from that time on he who incurred the penalties of law was taken to the chief, who sentenced
him accordingly. If the penalty be death, and the condemned man say that he prefers to be a slave, he is pardoned, and becomes
a slave. All the other chiefs are also judges, each in his own district; but when any important case arises the head chief
calls all the others together, in order to decide it, and the affair is settled by the vote of all. The chiefs are accustomed
to impose the taxes; but there is no fixed amount for these, save what the proper judge decrees shall be paid.

</p>
<p><i>Marriages</i>. These Moros followed in their marriages the same customs as those of the Pintados, in giving the dowry. Thus, if the man
should, contrary to the woman&#8217;s desire, break his pledge and annul the marriage, he would lose the dowry, and she would retain
it, free from him. Likewise, if the wife left the husband she was obliged to return him the dowry. If she committed adultery
and the husband therefore left her, she returned him double the amount of the dowry. If the wife left the husband in order
to marry another, the second husband was obliged to repay to <a id="d0e5572"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5572">172</a>]</span>the first husband the dowry which the latter had given to the woman, and to pay a fine, more or less&#8212;such an amount as the
judge should order him to give. If the husband were a chief, and caught his wife in the act of committing adultery, he had
the right to punish her with death, and the adulterer also, and could slay them with impunity. If he killed one and the other
escaped, there would be open war between the two families until the other adulterer died. If both escaped, they must pay for
their lives with a certain weight of gold. If they were chiefs, the penalty was one hundred taes, fifty for the woman and
fifty for the adulterer. This done, they were pardoned, and remained friends. If they were timaguas, they incurred a lighter
penalty.

</p>
<p><i>Wars</i>. In wars and slavery among the Moros, they observed the same customs as did the Pintados.

</p>
<p><i>Thieves</i>. There was among the natives a law concerning thieves. It was a petty theft if the amount were less than four taes (that
is, twenty pesos); but if more than that sum, it was a serious offense. He who committed the former must return the gold,
and then be sentenced, at the will of the judge, to pay a fine in money. If it were the greater theft, involving an amount
of four taes or upward, he incurred the penalty of slavery. But if the goods stolen amounted to a cati [catty] of gold, the
penalty was death, or the enslavement of the culprit and his children and all those of his household.

</p>
<p>It was also a law that for the first theft the penalty was a fine in money, and for the second, slavery; for further offenses,
it was death. Or if pardoned, as described above, he was made a slave, with his wife and children. This punishment did not
apply to the <a id="d0e5584"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5584">174</a>]</span>son who proved that he was outside the house&#8212;whether he dwelt in a house of his own or lived with relatives on an independent
footing; and therefore he was free. Only those who lived in the house of the delinquent were liable to punishment, because
they all were suspected of knowledge of the theft.

</p>
<p>There was also a law that anyone who spoke disrespectfully of a chief, or uttered abusive language to him, was liable to death.
If he could redeem his life, a fine of fifteen taes of gold was imposed. If he did not have the means to pay and relatives
did not contribute to ransom him, and the delinquent begged for mercy, saying that then he would become a slave, his life
was spared, and he became the slave of the injured party. For this reason the penalty of a fine was available for him who
possessed wealth. If the quarrel were between persons of equal rank, the chiefs settled the matter according to justice and
their laws, and the like penalty was imposed. If the delinquent refused to pay according to this sentence, war was declared
between the villages or the factions. Hostilities then followed; and from that time those who were captured were enslaved.

</p>
<p><i>One may be released after paying the sum decreed; until then he is a slave.</i> It was a law that if, when two timaguas were together, either of them insulted the other, he must pay a sum of money according
to the nature of the insult, which was decided by the judge. If the insult were a gross one, the fine was large accordingly;
and if the culprit had not the means to pay more than five taes, he became the slave of the injured person. If the delinquent
begged from the chief or some other friend the favor of lending him the money, he became the slave of him who <a id="d0e5592"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5592">176</a>]</span>loaned the money. This slavery extended only to the culprit, and not to his children or relatives, except to children who
were born during his slavery.

</p>
<p>It is usual among the natives of this island to aid one another with money-loans. He who borrowed from a chief or a timagua
retained the money until a fixed time had elapsed, during which he might use the money that was lent to him; and besides,
he divided with the lender the profit that he made, in acknowledgment of the favor that he had received.

</p>
<p>It was a law that if he who borrowed the money became insolvent, and had not means to pay his debt, he was considered a slave
therefor, together with the children born during his slavery; those already born were free.

</p>
<p>It was a law among these people, when two men formed a business partnership in which each placed the same amount of money,
that if one of them went to traffic with the money belonging to both, and while on a trading journey were captured by enemies,
the other man who remained in the village must go to ransom his partner, with half of the ransom-price agreed upon; and the
captive was then released from liability&#8212;not only for what was due to the partnership, but for the amount which was afterward
given for his ransom, and was not obliged to pay anything. If the man who lost the money lost it in gambling, or by spending
it with women, he was obliged to repay to the partnership the amount which he had drawn therefrom, and he and his children
were obliged to pay it. If the amount were so great that they could not pay it within the time agreed upon, he and half his
children would become the slaves of the partner. If there were two children, one was a slave <a id="d0e5600"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5600">178</a>]</span>and the other was free; if four, two were slaves, and two free; and so on with any larger number. If the children were able
to pay their father&#8217;s debt afterward, they were set free.

</p>
<p>It was a law that he who killed another must die; but if he begged for mercy he would become the slave of the dead man&#8217;s father,
children, or nearest relatives. If four or five men were concerned in the murder, they all paid to the master of the slave
the price which the slave might be worth; and then the judge sentenced them to such punishment as he thought just. If the
men had not means to pay the fine, they became slaves. If the dead man were a timagua, the penalty of death was incurred by
those who were proved to be his murderers; but if the condemned men begged for mercy they became slaves. Accordingly, after
they were sentenced the culprit might choose between death and slavery. If the man slain were a chief, the entire village
where he was slain must, when that was proved, become slaves, those who were most guilty being first put to death. If the
murderers were private persons only, three or four of the most guilty were put to death, without any resource in mercy; and
the rest, with their children, became slaves.

</p>
<p>When any person entered the house of a chief by night, against the will of the owner, he incurred the death penalty. It was
their custom that when such an offender was caught he was first tortured, to ascertain whether any other chief had sent him.
If he confessed that he had been thus sent, he was punished by enslavement; and he who had sent him incurred the death penalty,
but might be released therefrom by paying a certain amount of gold for the crime.
<a id="d0e5606"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5606">180</a>]</span></p>
<p>He who committed adultery was, if he were one of the chiefs, punished with death; the same penalty was inflicted upon any
man who was caught with the concubine of a chief. Similarly, the husband might kill the adulterer, if caught in the act. If
perchance he escaped by flight, he was condemned to pay a fine in money; and until this was done there was enmity between
the two families concerned. The same law was in force among the timaguas.

<h2>Letter from Domingo de Salazar to Felipe II</h2>
<p>Royal Catholic Majesty:

</p>
<p>After having written the letters and memoranda which are going to your Majesty, there came some neighboring Indians to this
city, who begged me to make known to your Majesty the contents of their testimonial. A few days afterward I told certain of
them that they should decide what they wished, and that I would write to your Majesty concerning them&#8212;as your Majesty is a
most Christian king who considers well their interests, and has commanded that they be well-treated, and will order punishment
for those who maltreat them.

</p>
<p>On the same day, some of the most prominent Indians came, and with them more than forty others from the neighboring villages.
They asked from me the things that I have stated elsewhere; and I certify to your Majesty that, if all that they said could
be written in this account, it would be but little shorter than the other one which I am sending to your Majesty. Without
doubt it would break your Majesty&#8217;s heart if you could see them as they are, and how pitiable are their appearance and the
things that they relate.

</p>
<p>Another day there came chiefs from other villages to say the same and much more. Today ten or twelve <a id="d0e5645"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5645">182</a>]</span>chiefs have come to see me from a province called Mauban, which belongs to your Majesty. They are all heathen, and told me
that they had learned that I wrote to your Majesty in their behalf. They asked me to remember them also. I did not wish to
admit more than what was said by those who came first, as it would make a disturbance in the land, should they all come here
to complain. Your Majesty will be pleased to command that their case be considered, and provision made for them. I can do
nothing, save to deplore it, and to beseech your Majesty for the remedy. Manila, June twenty, 1582.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Fray Domingo</span>, Bishop of the Felipinas
</p>
<hr><p>

</p>
<p>In the city of Manila, on the fifteenth day of the month of June, of the year one thousand five hundred and eighty-two, before
the very illustrious Don Fray Domingo de Salasar, first bishop of these islands and a member of his Majesty&#8217;s council, and
in the presence of me, the secretary undersigned, there appeared certain Indians who spoke through Francisco Morantes and
Andres de Cervantes, interpreters of the Moro tongue. They declared themselves to be Don Luis Amanicaldo, Don Martin Panga,
Don Gabriel Luanbacar, and Don Juan Bautangad, Christians; and Salalila and Calao Amarlenguaguay, heathen; and Do&ntilde;a Francisca
Saygan: all chiefs of the villages of Tondo and Capaymisilo; and many other chiefs. Through the interpreters, they said that
they had learned that by this ship which is about to depart for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, his most reverend Lordship was to write to his
Majesty. As they were suffering so many injuries, grievances, and vexations, <a id="d0e5655"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5655">183</a>]</span>as is well-known to all, they humbly begged that he be so kind as to inform his Majesty thereof in detail, in order that his
Majesty, after having learned of their afflictions, may be pleased to remedy them. They were then asked what things they desired
to be especially placed before his Majesty&#8217;s consideration, and to declare the same. They replied that the injuries which
they suffer, and which ought to be redressed, are those inflicted by the alcaldes-mayor. Much trouble is caused them by these
officials, as within three leagues there are four alcaldes-mayor and their officers, who inflict serious penalties for light
offenses. They take at their own price the rice of the Indians, and afterward sell it at a very high rate, doing the same
with all other articles of provisions and agricultural products. Furthermore, they oblige the Indians to act as their oarsmen,
whenever they wish. If they return from an expedition which has lasted a month, they are told straightway to prepare for another,
being paid nothing whatsoever; nevertheless in every village assessments are levied upon the natives, for the payment of those
who go on such service. If at any time they are paid, it is very little, and that very seldom. Because of the many acts of
oppression which they have suffered, many Indians have now abandoned Tondo, Capaymisilo, and other villages near this city
of Manila. They have gone to live in other provinces, which has occasioned much damage and loss to the chiefs. Out of the
three hundred Indians who were there, one hundred have gone away, and the said chiefs are obliged to pay the tribute for those
who flee and die, and for their slaves and little boys. If they do not pay these, they are placed in the stocks and flogged.
Others are <a id="d0e5657"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5657">184</a>]</span>tied to posts and kept there until they pay. Moreover, they dig no gold, for the officials oblige them to pay the fifth. If
they do not make a statement of their gold it is seized as forfeited, even when it is old gold; and the gold is not returned
to them until after payment of a heavy fine. They do not wish to let the alcaldes-mayor buy rice, because they all hoard it.
If the natives come to complain of their grievances to the alcaldes-mayor alone, they are imprisoned and thrown into the stocks,
and are charged with prison-fees. Their afflictions and troubles are so many that they cannot be endured; and they wish to
leave this island, or at least to go to some encomienda of a private individual. In the said villages of the king they cannot
endure the alcaldes-mayor.

<h2>Letter from Juan Baptista Roman to the Viceroy</h2>
<p>Most Illustrious and Excellent Sir:

</p>
<p>I do not know whether the letters with new information which the governor is writing today will arrive in time to go on this
ship, which has been despatched to this port of Acabite; so I wish to give your Excellency notice of what is going on. Yesterday&#8212;St.
John&#8217;s Day&#8212;in the afternoon, there arrived six soldiers who had gone with Captain Juan Pablo de Carrion<a id="d0e5687src" href="#d0e5687" class="noteref">1</a> against the Japanese, who are settled on the river Cagayan. They say that Juan Pablo sailed with his fleet&#8212;which comprised
the ship &#8220;Sant Jusepe,&#8221; the admiral&#8217;s galley, and five fragatas&#8212;from the port of Bigan, situated in Ylocos, about thirty-five
days&#8217; journey from Cagayan. As he sailed out, he encountered a Chinese pirate, who very soon surrendered. He put seventeen
soldiers aboard of her and continued his course. While rounding Cape Borgador near Cagayan one fair morning at dawn, they
found themselves near a Japanese ship, which Juan Pablo engaged with the admiral&#8217;s galley in which he himself was. With his
artillery <a id="d0e5693"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5693">186</a>]</span>he shot away their mainmast, and killed several men. The Japanese put out grappling-irons and poured two hundred men aboard
the galley, armed with pikes and breastplates. There remained sixty arquebusiers firing at our men. Finally, the enemy conquered
the galley as far as the mainmast. There our people also made a stand in their extreme necessity, and made the Japanese retreat
to their ship. They dropped their grappling-irons, and set their foresail, which still remained to them. At this moment the
ship &#8220;Sant Jusepe&#8221; grappled with them, and with the artillery and forces of the ship overcame the Japanese; the latter fought
valiantly until only eighteen remained, who gave themselves up, exhausted. Some men on the galley were killed, and among them
its captain, Pero Lucas, fighting valiantly as a good soldier. Then the captain, Juan Pablo, ascended the Cagayan River, and
found in the opening a fort and eleven Japanese ships. He passed along the upper shore because the mouth of the river is a
league in width. The ship &#8220;Sant Jusepe&#8221; was entering the river, and it happened by bad fortune that some of our soldiers,
who were in a small fragata, called out to the captain, saying to him: &#8220;Return, return to Manila! Set the whole fleet to return,
because there are a thousand Japanese on the river with a great deal of artillery, and we are few.&#8221; Whereupon Captain Luys
de Callejo directed his course seaward; and although Juan Pablos fired a piece of artillery he did not and could not enter,
and continued to tack back and forth. In the morning he anchored in a bay, where such a tempest overtook them that it broke
three cables out of four that he had, and one used for weighing anchor. He sent these six soldiers in a <a id="d0e5695"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5695">187</a>]</span>small vessel to see if there was on an islet any water, of which they were in great need. The men lost their way, without
finding any water; and when they returned where they had left their ship they could not find it. They met with some of those
Indians who were in the galley with Juan Pablos, from whom it was learned that Juan Pablo had ascended the river two leagues
and had fortified himself in a bay; and that with him was the galley, which had begun to leak everywhere, in the engagement
with the Japanese. The Indian crew was discharged on account of not having the supplies which were lost on the galley. Most
of these men went aboard the &#8220;Sant Jusepe.&#8221; They said that the Japanese were attacking them with eighteen <i>champans</i>,<a id="d0e5700src" href="#d0e5700" class="noteref">2</a> which are like skiffs. They were defending themselves well although there were but sixty soldiers with the seamen, and there
were a thousand of the enemy, of a race at once valorous and skilful. The six soldiers came with this news, and on the way
they met a sailor who had escaped from a Sangley ship which had sailed from here, with supplies of rice for Juan Pablo. He
says that the Sangleys mutinied at midnight and killed ten soldiers who were going with it as an escort, who had no sentinel.
This one escaped by swimming, with the aid of a lance that was hurled at him from the ship.

</p>
<p>Moreover, I have just detained some passengers <a id="d0e5713"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5713">188</a>]</span>who were going on this ship, because there are no troops on these islands, and a hundred soldiers have to go immediately as
a reenforcement, although the weather is tempestuous. I expect to be one of them, if the governor will give me permission.

</p>
<p>These enemies, who have in truth remained here, are a warlike people; and if your Excellency do not provide by this ship,
and reenforce us with a thousand soldiers, these islands can be of little value. May your Excellency with great prudence provide
what is most necessary for his Majesty&#8217;s service, since we have no resource other than the favor your Excellency shall order
to be extended to us.

</p>
<p>The governor was disposed to send assistance to the ship, which was a very important affair; but after these events he will
not be able to do it, because there do not remain in this city seventy men who can bear arms. May our Lord guard the most
illustrious and excellent person of your Excellency and increase your estate, as your Excellency&#8217;s servants desire. From Cabite,
June 25, 1582. Most excellent and illustrious sir, your servant kisses your Excellency&#8217;s hands.

<h2>Letter from Pe&ntilde;alosa to Felipe II</h2>
<p>Royal Catholic Majesty:

</p>
<p>By this ship, which is to leave these islands on the last of June of this year, I am giving your Majesty a full account of
the condition of affairs and events in this region. As it was about to sail news came of the fleet&#8212;which, I wrote among other
things, I had despatched to effect a settlement in Cagayan&#8212;and of the punishment and resistance of the Japanese pirates, of
whose coming we had news this year. The fleet sent by me, as above stated, met two vessels of the enemy near Cagayan, one
of Japanese and the other of Sangleys; an engagement ensued, and those vessels surrendered after a fierce fight, in which
two hundred Japanese, among them the commander of the fleet and his son, were killed, while we lost only three soldiers.

</p>
<p>Juan Pablo de Carrion, whom I sent as my lieutenant-general in charge of this fleet, continued his journey, and entered the
Cagayan River, where he was to make a settlement. At the entrance of the river he found six more Japanese vessels belonging
to the fleet of those which had surrendered. There was also a goodly number of people there, and fortifications. On account
of his lack of men&#8212;a severe storm having driven out to sea the flagship, which he took <a id="d0e5733"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5733">190</a>]</span>on this expedition&#8212;he did not sack these forts, but attempted only to enter the river. This he did, going up about six leagues,
where he made a settlement in a place where he could erect a fort, whence he could direct offensive and defensive warfare
against the enemy. This news came yesterday; and with all possible despatch I am sending re&euml;nforcements, boats, ammunition,
and the provisions necessary. I considered it so needful to employ the soldiers for this purpose, because too small a force
remains to me for the aid of Maluco, as I have written, since that undertaking is so important. However if they send from
that place to beg aid, I shall give it with what forces I can. For I suffer a great lack of men and other things because no
re&euml;nforcements have been sent me from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, although I have implored them. This land suffers from a constant and pressing
need of re&euml;nforcements, on account not only of its unhealthful climate, but of the many emergencies which continually arise
when I must send aid. These occasions now are not so much a matter of jest as they have been hitherto; for the Chinese and
Japanese are not Indians, but people as valiant as many of the inhabitants of Berberia [Barbary], and even more so. I entreat
your Majesty to give careful attention to this, and to order that in all vessels as many men as possible be sent; for it is
the key to what is necessary for the preservation of this camp. I beg also that careful attention be given in the other things.

</p>
<p>The gratuity for the expenses incurred in these necessary undertakings and for others similar to them, which are thrusting
themselves forward every moment&#8212;which was provided by your Majesty&#8217;s auditors of your royal Audiencia of Mexico in the <a id="d0e5737"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5737">191</a>]</span>ship arriving at this bay on the twenty-fourth of last month, consisted of a decree and warrant in which they order that Doctor
Sande be paid here for the time while he remained here after my arrival, and until his arrival at Mexico. For this purpose
they set aside in their decree the tributes which belong to your Majesty, and order that they be attached for this and sent
to them&#8212;threatening me with imprisonment if I do not comply. I have written to your Majesty already of the poor state of your
treasury here and its many pressing necessities, and of the extreme difficulty experienced in raising the amount needful for
the same. Will your Majesty please take suitable action in this? for without the aid of what little resources your Majesty
possesses here, this colony cannot be preserved. May our Lord guard the Catholic and royal person of your Majesty for mary
prosperous years, and give you increase of many kingdoms and seigniories for the good of Christianity. Manila, July first,
82.

<h2>Two Papal Decrees</h2>
<p class="div2"></p>
<h3>Indulgence Granted to the Dominicans on Their Setting Out for the Philippines</h3>
<p>Gregory, Bishop, servant of the servants of God: In perpetual remembrance of the affair.

</p>
<p>Since, as we have learned, very vast kingdoms, islands, cities, and towns in the parts of the Western Indias are being converted
to the faith of Christ, and daily the light of heavenly learning is beaming on the peoples thereof&#8212;who, hitherto unacquainted
with the law of God, and under the yoke of the demon, were groping their way in the dark places of unbelief; but now, rejecting
the errors of heathenism, are revering and following the name of our Savior Jesus Christ: therefore our beloved son, the master-general
of the Order of Preachers<a id="d0e5755src" href="#d0e5755" class="noteref">1</a> [Dominicans], has determined to send thither professed members under the care of their own vicar, with rules for austere
life and a reformed standard of conduct&#8212;as is becoming to a religious and praiseworthy institute, and according to which their
province of New Spain was established&#8212;who there may found a new province of their order.

</p>
<p>We, on whom through appointment of the Lord it <a id="d0e5760"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5760">193</a>]</span>is incumbent to foster the spread of the gospel, desirous of taking part in this duty of preaching the gospel in kingdoms
wherein Christ is unknown, desirous moreover to aid, in as faras we can, the pious and religious endeavors of the Friars Preachers&#8212;who,
with their abandonment of fatherland and their self-denial of comforts, are now exposing themselves to dangers of land and
sea for the sake of spreading the name of Christ&#8212;therefore, trusting in the mercy of almighty God and the authority of His
blessed apostles Peter and Paul, we by our apostolic authority, in virtue of these presents do grant, etc., a plenary indulgence
and remission of all their sins to the professed members of the said Order, all and singular, if really penitent and confessed,
who by leave or order or mandate of their afore-named master-general shall go to the Philippine Islands.

</p>
<p>Given at Rome, at St. Mark&#8217;s, under the seal of the Fisherman, on the fifteenth day of September, in the year 1582, the eleventh
of our pontificate.

<p class="div2"></p>
<h3>Foundation of the Province of the Dominicans in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Gregory XIII, Pope. Beloved son, health and apostolic blessing.

</p>
<p>Not long ago you acquainted us with the fact that, some time before, Paul Conestabile, master-general of the entire order
of Friars Preachers, gave you leave&#8212;with thirty or forty professed members of the said order, to be gathered by you from the
provinces of Spain, Aragon and Andalusia, and ten from the province of Mexico and from Chiappa,<a id="d0e5771src" href="#d0e5771" class="noteref">2</a> to go to the <a id="d0e5774"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5774">194</a>]</span>Philippine Islands and to the kingdom of China. Moreover, appointing you his vicar-general in the said Philippine Islands
and kingdom of China, etc., he granted to you, all and singular, the privileges which had been granted by former generals
to the province of Santiago of Mexico&#8212;to the end that you might there establish a rule of life in accordance with the same,
and found provinces, etc.

</p>
<p>But since, as you also told us, the said General Paul is dead, and there are some who are doubtful of your power in the premises,
and therefore you have humbly petitioned us to determine what through our apostolic bounty you should do in the premises:
therefore, holding that you are free from any sort of excommunication, etc., and by these presents decreeing that the tenor
of the said letters is to be considered as if herein expressed; moreover, being not unwilling to hearken to your petition,
we by our apostolic authority, in virtue of these presents, approve and confirm the things contained therein, all and singular;
and, as far as needs be, do again depute you to the aforesaid charge,<a id="d0e5778src" href="#d0e5778" class="noteref">3</a> etc.

</p>
<p>Given at Rome, at St. Peter&#8217;s, under the seal of the Fisherman, on the twentieth day of October in the year 1582, the eleventh

<h2>Report on the Offices Saleable in the Philippines</h2>
<p>The following are the saleable offices in these Philipinas islands, from which some gain may be derived.

</p>
<p>Seven positions as city magistrates in Manila; because, of the twelve which are available, three are filled with officials
of his Majesty, and two by Captain Juan de Moron and by Pedro de Herrera, both possessing titles from his Majesty.

</p>
<p>Two offices as notaries-public in the same city; for, of the three available, one is filled by Diego Alem&aacute;n who was appointed
by his Majesty, and the other two are appointed by the governors, and therefore are not royal notaries.

</p>
<p>A notary of the cabildo, for no one has been supplied by his Majesty.

</p>
<p>The office of alguacil-mayor [high constable] in this city was held by Hernan Lopez: he has lived during the last three years
in Mexico, where he has married, and has not attended to his office; and consequently the governor disposes of this position.
More will be given for this office on account of its dignity, as holding a seat in the cabildo next to the royal officials.

</p>
<p>The office of chief clerk of registers and mines of <a id="d0e5801"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5801">196</a>]</span>these islands; for no appointment has been made by his Majesty.

</p>
<p>Six magistrates for the town of Zubu, which is the required number. No one has been appointed by his Majesty.

</p>
<p>In the said town, two notaries&#8212;one public, and the other for the cabildo; for they have not been filled by his Majesty.

</p>
<p>In the said town, the office of alguacil-mayor; for his Majesty has made no provision for the said dignity.

</p>
<p>The offices which are available in the town of Zubu are also available in the town of Ca&ccedil;eres, in the province of Camarines;
and in the town of Arevalo, in the island of Panai.

</p>
<p>The town of Fernandina in the province of Ylocos has proved to be so unhealthy a region that, from being the richest town
of these islands, it has now only a few inhabitants with no organized cabildo or government.

</p>
<p>The city of Segovia, in the province of Cagayan, is a newly-settled city. The offices have been filled by the governor with
the early conquerors; it will therefore be convenient for his Majesty to confirm them, in order that the community may become
permanently settled.

</p>
<p>Concerning the office of alcalde-mayor in the villages and provinces of the Indians, the following method is carried out.
The alcalde-mayor, who goes there for a year or two, takes with him his own alguacil and clerk, appointed by himself. The
lawsuits which take place before them are seldom made public; and they can keep the fines forfeited to the royal treasury&#8212;which
are not slight, for they fine the <a id="d0e5817"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5817">197</a>]</span>natives even for treading the ground. They keep neither archives nor record of anything, so that his Majesty is ill served
in their office; the natives suffer, and the officials condemn themselves. In view of all this, it would be better for each
province of Indians possessing the office of alcalde-mayor to have a permanent alguacil and clerk appointed by his Majesty;
for if they are not appointed by the alcalde and are not his servants, they will not conform so thoroughly to his will. Thus
light would be shed upon the legal proceedings, of which an account would be kept; and the fines forfeited to the royal treasury
would not be lost, together with the expenses of justice. Finally, if they are appointed permanently, they will aim at the
preservation of the Indians for their own benefit, and will not plunder and then go away, as they do now. The three most important
provinces in which an alcalde resides are: the province of Pampanga, which is the most fertile region of these islands, and
which has about thirty thousand Indians; the province of La Laguna de Bai, with a like number of Indians; and the province
of Bombon, Balaian, Mindoro, with about twenty thousand Indians. I believe that in these three provinces the offices of alguacil
and clerk will be of no less value than they are in Spanish communities. In the other provinces, these offices are of little
importance at present.

the advancement and preservation of those islands, upon which his Majesty has set his eyes so fixedly, and which have cost
so many thousands of ducats and Spanish lives. May what has been asked be provided, according to the memorials which I have
<a id="d0e5865"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5865">200</a>]</span>presented to the royal person and to your Highness; for it befits the service of God our Lord, that of your Highness, and

<p>The appointment of Don Gonzalo Ronquillo<a id="d0e5869src" href="#d0e5869" class="noteref">3</a> by your Highness as governor for life, and the many sentences, decrees, and favors in his behalf, greatly injure the said
islands in their advancement; they harass and totally ruin them as we have seen with our own eyes. Such an appointment is
contrary to the orders and laws given for the new discoveries; for the Filipinas islands were discovered more than fifty years
ago, and were settled at the time of the emperor (may he rest in peace). Since a way of return to Nueba Espa&ntilde;a had not been
discovered, the settlers for lack of sustenance abandoned the land, until the viceroy, Don Luis de Belasco, by order of your
Highness despatched a fleet to the said islands, and sent Miguel Lopez de Legazpi as governor, who made a settlement and discovered
a way of return. He went there at his own expense. All favors granted him in the meantime were so small and inadequate that
he was not even allowed to take a repartimiento. The islands have been settled for twenty years, and have enjoyed peace and
quiet.<a id="d0e5872src" href="#d0e5872" class="noteref">4</a> The appointment may <a id="d0e5875"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5875">201</a>]</span>have been a very lawful one, but it should not be forgotten that it is injurious to the said islands and their advancement.
God alone can remedy the abuses perpetrated every day, for, as is well known by your Highness, they are beyond any other remedy&#8212;inasmuch
as Don Gonzalo has carried out no part of the agreement he made with his Majesty. In regard to this, and the papers and memorials
which I have presented, may your very Christian Highness take the measures befitting the service of God, and the advancement
and good government of those islands.

is: &#8220;Simancas&#8212;Filipinas: Descubrimientos, etc., a&ntilde;os 1566 &aacute; 1586; Est. 1, caj. 1, leg. 2|24.&#8221; Morga says that Ribera was created Mariscal of Bonbon while in Spain. The effect of his mission was the establishment of
the Audiencia of Manila, whose president was to fill the offices of governor and captain-general of the islands. This was
attained after the death of Ronquillo, although that event was unknown in court at the time.

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a id="d0e5869" href="#d0e5869src" class="noteref">3</a></span> Gonzalo Ronquillo was governor from 1580 until his death in 1583. Morga says that trade with the Chinese was increased during
his governorship. He attempted to discover a return route to New Spain through the southern seas, but was unsuccessful. He
opened trade with Peru. A duty of two per cent on merchandise sent to New Spain was imposed by him, and one of three per cent
on goods imported by the Chinese.

been the latter year.

<h2>Affairs in the Philipinas Islands</h2>
<p><span class="smallcaps">By Fray Domingo de Salazar</span>


</p>
<p><i>Memorial regarding occurrences in these Philipinas Islands of the West, also their condition, and matters which require correction;
written by Fray Domingo de Salazar, bishop of the said islands, in order that his Majesty and the gentlemen of his royal Council
of the Indies may see it.</i>


</p>
<p>At first, when the Spaniards came to these islands, there was a great abundance of provisions, such as are produced in the
country; namely, rice, beans, fowls, swine, deer, buffaloes, fish, cocoanuts, bananas and some other fruits, wine, and honey.
Of these a large quantity could be bought from the natives with very little money. Although among them there was gold, with
which they traded and trafficked, yet it was most usual to barter eatables for rice until the Spaniards introduced the use
of money, from which no little harm has come to the country. Wine and rice are measured by the ganta, which is equivalent
to a quarter of a celem&iacute;n in our measure.

</p>
<p>The prices which articles brought after the Spaniards introduced silver coins&#8212;which are, as a rule, tost&oacute;ns, as the four-real
pieces are called&#8212;were as <a id="d0e5897"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5897">203</a>]</span>follows: [four]<a id="d0e5899src" href="#d0e5899" class="noteref">1</a> hundred gantas of rice [for one tost&oacute;n]; for another, a hundred of wine; and for another, twelve, fourteen, or sixteen fowls;
and other things in proportion. These rates continued until a year and a half or two years ago. Then products began to be
scarce in this country, and articles which were formerly cried through the streets have today reached so high prices and such
scarcity that there is now no one who can obtain them, even when they go to search for them in the Indian villages. For what
is thus found the common prices are forty or fifty gantas of rice, or eight or ten gantas of wine, for one tost&oacute;n; fowls have
advanced to two reals apiece, although the usual price is one real; while a hog costs four or five pesos, or six or eight
for one of considerable size. Oil of agenxoli [sesame], cocoanuts, and butter, which formerly could be bought very cheaply,
cannot now be obtained&#8212;although in this there is variation, as little or much comes to the market.

</p>
<p>I have tried to ascertain the reason for so great a change, and for the dearness of food; and after thoroughly informing myself
through persons who know, and through what I have seen with my own eyes, I find the following reasons therefor. First: When
Don Gon&ccedil;alo Ronquillo came here as governor of La <a id="d0e5922"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5922">204</a>]</span>Pampanga,<a id="d0e5924src" href="#d0e5924" class="noteref">2</a> whence all this country used to be supplied with rice, wine, and fowls, a great number of Indians went to the mines of Ylocos,
where they remained during the time when they ought to have sowed their grain. Many of them died there, and those who returned
were so fatigued that they needed rest more than work. As a result, in that year followed a very great scarcity of rice, and
for lack of it a great number of Indians in the said Pampanga died from hunger. In Luvao alone, the encomienda of Guido de
la Va&ccedil;ares, the dead exceeded a thousand.

</p>
<p>Second: in regard to the many occupations in which the Spaniards employ the Indians, such as setting them to row in the galleys
and fragatas despatched by the governor and officials on various commissions, which are never lacking. At times they go so
far away that they are absent four or six months; and many of those who go die there. Others run away and hide in the mountains,
to escape from the toils imposed upon them. Others the Spaniards employ in cutting wood in the forests and conveying it to
this city, and other Indians in other labors, so that they do not permit them to rest or to attend to their fields. Consequently,
they sow little and reap less, and have no opportunity to attend religious instruction. It sometimes happens that while these
miserable creatures are being instructed for baptism the Spaniards force them to go to the tasks that I have mentioned; and
when they return they have forgotten what they knew; for this reason there are today many Indians to be baptized. In some
cases when I have gone to a village to administer confirmation, I have returned without confirming any one, because <a id="d0e5932"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5932">205</a>]</span>the Indians were not in the place, but were occupied in labors ordered by the alcalde-mayor, and I could not collect them
together. In proof of this, I send a mandate issued by a deputy of Tondo. (I was present at the time, and all the people were
away, occupied in the tasks assigned to them; and the only Indians in the village were those who were being instructed for
the reception of baptism.) This ordinance commanded all the Indians of the said village to cut wood, and those who were receiving
instruction to quit it.

</p>
<p>Third: Before the governor Don Gon&ccedil;alo Ronquillo came, there were not more than three or four alcaldes-mayor in all these
islands; but now there are sixteen and most of them are men who came with him. As they came poor, and as the salaries are
small, they have taken away the Indians&#8212;as all affirm, and it is common talk&#8212;at the time for harvesting rice; and they buy
up all other provisions, and many profit by selling them again. In this way everything has become dear, because, as they have
forbidden the Indians to trade and traffic, they sell at whatever price they wish. Formerly the Indians brought their produce
to the gates, and sold it at very low-prices; for they are satisfied with very little gain, which is not true of the Spaniards.
But, not to ascribe all the guilt to men, but to our sins, the cause of this dearness has in part been that these years have
not afforded as good weather as others. This is the state in which the country has thus far been up to the present.


</p>
<p><i>Injuries inflicted upon the Indians</i>

</p>
<p>First: When a long expedition is to be made, the <a id="d0e5942"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5942">206</a>]</span>wrongs which they suffer are many. One is to despatch for the Indians who are to row in a galley or fragata a sailor who has
neither piety nor Christian feeling. Moreover, it is notorious that, without inquiring whether an Indian is married or single,
or whether his wife is sick or his children without clothing, he takes them all away. It has happened that when a husband
has led this deputy to his wife, who was great with child, and has asked with tears that he might be left behind as she had
no one to care for her, the sailor has beaten her with cudgels in order to make her go, and the poor husband also, despite
his resistance. In other cases, their wives are abandoned when dying, the husband being compelled to go away to row. The Indians
are put into irons on the galleys, and flogged as if they were galley-slaves or prisoners. Moreover, the pay that is given
them is very small; for they give each man only four reals a month&#8212;and this is so irregularly paid that most of them never
see it. The [officials of the] villages from which they take the rowers divide the pay among themselves, or give it to those
whom they impress as oarsmen. This statement is thoroughly authenticated; for when the governor, Don Gon&ccedil;alo Ronquillo, sent
to the mines, in Vitis and Lobao alone they divided three thousand pesos belonging to the Indians themselves; and when he
sent to Borney, in Bonb&oacute;n they divided more than two thousand. They say that in all Pampanga five or six thousand pesos were
taken, and similarly in all towns where they get recruits.

</p>
<p>Sometimes they do not go at harvest-time to collect the rice which they say belongs to your Majesty, but only when it is very
dear; and then they require <a id="d0e5946"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5946">207</a>]</span>it to be sold for the price which it was worth when they harvested. Sometimes the Indians buy back for five or six tostons
what they sold for one. The past year, when the Indians ate shoots of palms and bananas because they had no rice, and many
Indians died from hunger, they made them sell the remaining rice at the price which it was worth at harvest-time. Sometimes
the entire quantity of his rice is taken from an Indian, without leaving him a grain to eat. One poor widow, seeing that they
were carrying off all her rice without leaving her a grain to eat, took, as best she could, two basketfuls to hide under the
altar, and there saved them; but it is certain that if the collector had known it, they would have been taken from that place.

</p>
<p>Another injury that they do to this poor people, under pretense of its being for your Majesty, whereby your royal name is
detested among them, is as follows. Formerly, when rice was plentiful, four hundred gantas were worth one tost&oacute;n; your Majesty&#8217;s
officials of La Pampanga furnished me with the price which it was worth. Last year the governor ordered that twelve thousand
fan&eacute;gas of rice be taken from La Pampanga for your Majesty, and that the Indians should give three hundred gantas for one
tost&oacute;n. It was then worth among them about a peso of gold, because it could not be had at any price. Many Indians died of
hunger. The three hundred gantas which they took from them for one tost&oacute;n were worth about six tost&oacute;ns, and a person who wished
to buy it could not find it. This present year, when they have so little grain and the famine is so great in La Pampanga,
the Spaniards might have sent to other districts to buy rice, where&#8212;although they must go <a id="d0e5950"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5950">208</a>]</span>farther&#8212;it is more plentiful, and could be taken without injuring the Indians. Yet the Spaniards have chosen not to do this,
but rather to order that it be taken from La Pampanga. And while the price among the Indians is fifty gantas for one tost&oacute;n,
they require them to give for your Majesty at the rate of two hundred and fifty gantas. At the season when this was collected,
I was visiting La Pampanga, and I saw so much weeping and moaning on the part of the wretched Indians from whom they took
the rice, that it moved me to great pity&#8212;and all the more since I could see so little means to provide a remedy; for although
I wrote about it to the master-of-camp, who was at that time lieutenant-governor, it profited me little.

</p>
<p>As for the means of collecting this rice, the alcalde-mayor or his deputy divides among the chiefs two, three, four, or more
taes of gold (which is a certain weight worth five pesos), and orders that so many gantas of rice be collected for one tost&oacute;n.
Afterward they send, to collect this rice, men without piety; who, with blows, torture, and imprisonment enforce compliance
with the rate of three hundred and fifty gantas for a tost&oacute;n; and, in other years, one hundred of wine, and this year, sixty.
It is a fact well established, for I have learned from the very persons who collect it that it often happens, that the Indian,
not having so much rice as is demanded, is obliged to go to buy at the rate of fifty gantas for a tost&oacute;n, and fifteen gantas
of wine; and from him, as is said, they take two hundred and fifty of rice and seventy of wine for one tost&oacute;n. If this occurred
only with respect to rice, which is necessary for the expense which your Majesty incurs in this city, it would be but half
<a id="d0e5954"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5954">209</a>]</span>a wrong, although I do not know what law permits them to invent one price for your Majesty and another for others. However
this may be, I will pass on. But the real evil is that the governor, master-of-camp, alcaldes-mayor, your Majesty&#8217;s officials
and other persons to whom these wish to give it, all consume it at this same price, and they also collect it at this price
for the hospitals of the city. Although the governor, in the orders which he gives for the hospitals and for other persons,
such as alcaldes-mayor, does not name the number of gantas to be given for a tost&oacute;n, yet the rate is not higher than for your
Majesty. He is at fault, in that&#8212;knowing that they collect at this price&#8212;he neither causes what has thus been taken to be
restored, nor punishes him who transgresses in this matter; thus many dare to take rice from them at these same prices, knowing
that they will not be punished. I know that many alcaldes-mayor, having orders from the governor to buy from the Indians of
their districts three hundred fan&eacute;gas from each single man and five hundred from each married man, take it at the aforesaid
price, and even much more than they are permitted to take, and sell it again at the current price. I know that they also go
to collect, at the price fixed for your Majesty, for themselves and their friends, much more rice than they have a right to
take according to order. The same is true in regard to cutting timber.

</p>
<p>They compel the Indians to work at tasks in the service of your Majesty, paying them but little, and that irregularly and
late, and often not at all.

</p>
<p>I do not mention the injuries which the Indians received from the Spaniards during the conquest, for from what happened to
them in other parts of the <a id="d0e5960"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5960">210</a>]</span>Yndias can be inferred what would happen here, which was not less, but in many places much more. I speak of what has happened
and now happens in the collection of the tributes, so that your Majesty may see if it is right to overlook or tolerate things
which go so far beyond all human justice.

</p>
<p>As for the first, your Majesty may be assured that heretofore these Indians never have understood, nor have they been given
to understand, that the Spaniards entered this country for any other purpose than to subjugate them and compel them to pay
tributes. As this is a thing which all peoples naturally refuse, it follows that where they have been able to resist they
have always done so, and have gone to war. When they can do no more, they say that they will pay tribute. And these people
the Spaniards call pacified, and say that they have submitted to your Majesty! And without telling them more of God and of
the benefits which it was intended to confer upon them, they demand tribute from them each year. Their custom therein is as
follows. As soon as the Spaniards have subjugated them, and they have promised to pay tribute (for from us Christians they
hear no other word than &#8220;Pay tribute&#8221;), they say to the natives, &#8220;You must give so much a year.&#8221; If they are not allotted
in encomiendas, the governor sends some one to collect the tributes; but it is most usual to allot them at once in an encomienda
to him who has charge of collecting the tributes. Although the decree relating to encomiendas says, &#8220;Provided that you instruct
them in the matters of our most holy faith,&#8221; the only care that they have for that is, that the encomendero takes with him
eight or ten soldiers with their arquebuses <a id="d0e5964"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5964">211</a>]</span>and weapons, orders the chiefs to be called, and demands that they give him the tributes for all the Indians of their village.
Here my powers fail me, I lack the courage, and I can find no words, to express to your Majesty the misfortunes, injuries,
and vexations, the torments and miseries, which the Indians are made to suffer in the collection of the tributes. The tribute
at which all are commonly rated is the value of eight reals, paid in gold or in produce which they gather from their lands;
but this rate is observed like all other rules that are in favor of the Indians&#8212;that is, it is never observed at all. Some
they compel to pay it in gold, even when they do not have it. In regard to the gold likewise, there are great abuses, because
as there are vast differences in gold here, they always make the natives give the finest. The weight at which they receive
the tribute is what he who collects it wishes, and he never selects the lightest. Others make them pay cloth or thread. But
the evil is not here, but in the manner of collecting; for, if the chief does not give them as much gold as they demand, or
does not pay for as many Indians as they say there are, they crucify the unfortunate chief, or put his head in the stocks&#8212;for
all the encomenderos, when they go to collect, have their stocks, and there they lash and torment the chiefs until they give
the entire sum demanded from them. Sometimes the wife or daughter of the chief is seized, when he himself does not appear.
Many are the chiefs who have died of torture in the manner which I have stated. When I was in the port of Ybalon some chiefs
came there to see me; and the first thing they said to me was, that one who was collecting the tributes in that settlement
had killed a chief by torture, and the <a id="d0e5966"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5966">212</a>]</span>same Indians indicated the manner in which he had been killed, which was by crucifixion, and hanging him by the arms. I saw
this soldier in the town of Caceres, in the province of Camarines, and learned that the justice arrested him for it and fined
him fifty pesos&#8212;to be divided equally between the exchequer and the expenses of justice&#8212;and that with this punishment he was
immediately set free. Likewise I learned that an encomendero&#8212;because a chief had neither gold nor silver nor cloth with which
to pay the tribute&#8212;exacted from him an Indian for nine pesos, in payment of nine tributes which he owed; and then took this
Indian to the ship and sold him for thirty-five pesos. And although I told this to the steward and asked for the Indian, he
remained in slavery. They collect tribute from children, old men, and slaves, and many remain unmarried because of the tribute,
while others kill their children.

</p>
<p>What the encomendero does, after having collected his tributes in the manner stated, is to return home; and for another year
he neither sees nor hears of them. He takes no more account of them than if they were deer, until the next year, when the
same thing is repeated. These injuries the Spaniards inflicted in all places until recently. In this district of Manila there
is not so much of it now, because many of the natives are already Christians, and there are religious among them, and affairs
are in better order. But in remote places and some not very far away, what I have stated occurs, and even worse things are
done. Because all, or nearly all, of those who pay the tribute are infidels, and neither know nor understand more of the matters
of our faith than they did a hundred years ago, and even more on account of the <a id="d0e5970"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5970">213</a>]</span>wrongs which they suffer, they abhor and abominate the faith. Indeed, as for the example of decency which those who mingle
with the Indians set them there is no way to describe it here without offending your Majesty&#8217;s ears; but I state it as an
assured fact that they care not whether a woman be a believer or an infidel, single or married; all are on the same level.
From this your Majesty will gather what these unhappy Indians will have conceived of us and of the faith which we preach.

</p>
<p>I shall not omit to mention here a thing which is full of reproach to the Christians who have lived here, and even to all
of us who hear it&#8212;namely, that the natives of these islands have been, from ancient times, infidels, of whom there are many
now in this and other islands; and that the Moros have come to these islands from that of Burney to preach the law of Mahoma,
through which preaching a large number of pagans have turned Moros. Those who have received this vile law keep it with much
pertinacity, and there is great difficulty in getting them to leave it. Moreover it is known that the reason which they give&#8212;to
our shame and confusion&#8212;is that they were better treated by the preachers of Mahoma than they have been and are by the preachers
of Christ.<a id="d0e5974src" href="#d0e5974" class="noteref">3</a> Since, through kind and gentle treatment, they received that doctrine willingly, it took root in their hearts, and so they
leave it reluctantly. But this is not the case with what we preach to them, for, as it is accompanied with so much bad treatment
and with so evil examples, they say &#8220;yes&#8221; with the mouth and &#8220;no&#8221; <a id="d0e5980"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e5980">214</a>]</span>with the heart; and thus when occasion arises they leave it, although by the mercy of God, this is becoming somewhat remedied
by the coming of the ministers of the gospel, with whose advent these grievances cease in some places. After Don Ger&oacute;nimo<a id="d0e5982src" href="#d0e5982" class="noteref">4</a> Ronquillo carne to govern, [it was decreed] that from the Indians should be taken the [taels?]<a id="d0e5988src" href="#d0e5988" class="noteref">5</a> of gold which the Indians manufacture. Whether or not this has been done by order of your Majesty, I do not know; but I know
that if your Majesty were in this country you would not order this law to be executed now; because most of them are still
infidels, and I do not know what right there is to exact these taxes from the infidel, nor to what a people so [<i>illegible in original MS.</i>] might be driven by such rigor. From this result many injuries to the Indians. For, as is well known, they have wrought the
gold which they received from their ancestors, and they regard it as lost.<a id="d0e6000src" href="#d0e6000" class="noteref">6</a> All the Indians are compelled to declare all the gold that they possess, and the amounts are placed on a list, in order that
if they should come into possession of more gold in the future, it may be taken from them&#8212;not as the royal <a id="d0e6009"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6009">215</a>]</span>fifth, but as forfeited. Moreover as these Indians wear chains and ajorcas,<a id="d0e6011src" href="#d0e6011" class="noteref">7</a> the alcaldes-mayor, in the attempt to profit thereby, require that these should be declared, on the ground that these are
ornaments which the Indians have manufactured, and on which they have not paid the fifth; and although this may be a lie,
it costs the Indian, before he is free, a good share of his gold. Indeed, they denounced an Indian before the governor himself;
and in spite of many entreaties from religious, he fined the Indian one hundred and twenty pesos, which was the third part
of the gold about which he was accused. A religious assured me that it was gold received from his ancestors; but the Indian
could not help himself.

</p>
<p>I could never finish&#8212;and it would be a very annoying subject for your Majesty&#8212;relating all the hardships that befall these
unfortunates in this country. They ought to be feasted and favored, in order that they may become attached to our faith, and
understand the mercy that God has shown them in bringing them to the knowledge and manifestation of it; but those who here
continue to forget this are the cause of their abhorring the faith. They consider your Majesty a cruel king, and think that
you are trying only to profit by their estates and to claim their personal service&#8212;although all is so much to the contrary
on the part of your Majesty, as witness the holy laws and ordinances which, for the good government of these lands, your Majesty
has made and ordered to be observed.

</p>
<p>But if it is true, most Christian king, that the intent of your Majesty in sending Spaniards to these lands <a id="d0e6018"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6018">216</a>]</span>is that God may be known, His faith preached, and His holy law received here; and that these Indians, by love, good works,
and example, may be led to the knowledge of God and obedience to your Majesty&#8212;what law or right permits individuals to transgress
in this matter by their greed and self-interest, and to do the opposite of that for which your Majesty sent them? This purpose
is that in your royal name and with holy royal authority they may govern this country, dignified for this task by very honorable
titles, and remunerated by large salaries, your Majesty so affectionately charging them to treat these natives well, and giving
them for that purpose such holy laws, ordinances, and instructions. Yet these men turn aside their eyes from all this and
close them to the injuries and ill-treatment which these unfortunates receive. What abhorrence to our holy faith arises in
their minds from this conduct, and what an impediment to the conversion of the infidels is thus formed! And those who are
already converted are regretting that step; for these men concern themselves so entirely with getting rich in the shortest
possible time, to which end they are continually planning and undertaking every means which seems to them best suited to attain
that object&#8212;even though it may be contrary to your Majesty&#8217;s commands and prohibited by the laws of the kingdom and the ordinances
of the Yndias, and though it may be injurious and prejudicial to those whom they were charged, by the authority of your Majesty,
to make free, and to secure from all those wrongs. If this be true, what punishment would be fitting for such a crime? Or
how could your Majesty so overlook a thing so pernicious, that you should not order it to be punished <a id="d0e6020"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6020">217</a>]</span>rigorously, and should not remedy evils which so greatly need correction? But whether this is so or not, it is not for me
to accuse or to speak ill of any one. I only say, and truthfully, that this land is ruined; and it is doubtful whether, if
it experiences another year like the two just past, it will endure till the third&#8212;and this is no exaggeration.

</p>
<p>In the ship which just arrived from Nueba Espa&ntilde;a came certain royal decrees&#8212;a remedy for some evils of which information had
been given. It seems that the country received thereby some alleviation of its troubles, but I do not know what will follow.
It is a great misfortune to have your Majesty so far away. For if you were near us, all these ills would soon disappear&#8212;as
I hope, by the Divine goodness and your Majesty&#8217;s holy zeal, that they will not endure longer than till you shall hear of
them, not by my report, but by information which may be quite sufficiently obtained in Nueba Espa&ntilde;a; for what I say here is
for no other purpose than that your Majesty may be informed of what is going on, and that you may order it to be remedied.

</p>
<p>Since your Majesty orders, by your royal decree, that in case the governor do not keep the royal laws and ordinances which
are made for these lands, I advise your Majesty of the fact: what might in compliance be said with entire truthfulness is,
that I do not know what decree, provision, or ordinance issued for the benefit and aid of the Indians is kept or noticed;
and if any promise is made, it is only for courtesy. Never have I seen any man punished who may have violated the decrees,
or who may be scandalous in sin; and in order that it may be quite evident to your Majesty how badly your holy laws are <a id="d0e6026"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6026">218</a>]</span>kept, I shall proceed to demonstrate by the royal ordinances.

</p>
<p>2nd. The second clause, commencing, &#8220;those who administer government,&#8221; etc., is neither kept nor noticed, because it never
is taken into account. Therefore the Indians understand that the good which is to be done them is but to subjugate them and
make them pay tribute; and as this is the purpose of those in authority, they never do what is ordered in this clause, but
at once send soldiers to force the Indians to submit although they may not desire it; and before they return they leave the
natives subjects and tributarios.

</p>
<p>4th. Clause four, for the same reason, is not heeded.

</p>
<p>20th. In regard to clause 20, although it is so necessary, and so deserves to be obeyed, those in power act as if they were
ordered to do the very opposite, as is explained above, where I discuss the wrongs that they inflict.

</p>
<p>24th. To what is ordered in clause 24 some respect is now paid in this island; but heretofore everything has been done in
contravention of it, and the penalty has never been enforced.

</p>
<p>25th. Nor has clause 25 been observed in this island. On the contrary, there has been, I say plainly, a notable diminution
in the royal exchequer, and the difficulties which are mentioned in the clause result.

</p>
<p>29th. With regard to clause 29, the deeds of those who go on these expeditions are so contrary to the orders given in this
clause that it would appear that they are sent to rob, rather than to pacify.

</p>
<p>30th. Clause 30 is the least respected of all those contained in this book of ordinances, as was said, and there is most necessity
for its observance. It is, moreover, <a id="d0e6042"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6042">219</a>]</span>certain that all the other ordinances are regulated by what is here commanded.

</p>
<p>32nd. To clause 32, which treats of new settlements, no more attention is paid than if it had not been written. For no settlement
is either made or contemplated in this island; no Spanish town has any pasture for cattle, or land for cultivation, although
that would be a great convenience; and those who wish to undertake anything of the sort&#8212;for there are two or three such&#8212;are
granted no favor when this matter is discussed; nor is there any one who remembers the law.

</p>
<p>33rd. No attention is paid to clause 33, nor is the pacification of the natives conducted on any orderly plan&#8212;except that
here and there some men are sent to make the Indians tributary, without attention to securing their pacification or settlement.
Some attention was, however, given to this in the expedition which was just made to Cagayan.

</p>
<p>36th. We all know well that the principal aim of your Majesty is that expressed in clause 36, but this is not the aim of those
who govern; accordingly, they do little for the conversion of the Indians, but much for their own profit.

</p>
<p>138th. The part of clause 138 which is observed, for good or bad, is to subjugate the Indians and compel them to pay tribute;
beyond this there is neither care nor thought.

</p>
<p>139th. For the like reason, clause 139 is not observed, nor is there thought of it.

</p>
<p>141st. Of what is ordered in clause 141 nothing is observed; for they care no more for rendering justice to the Indians than
if these were beasts who lack reason.
<a id="d0e6056"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6056">220</a>]</span></p>
<p>144th. The part of clause 144 most important for observance was that beginning &#8220;the country being pacified&#8221; [<i>illegible in original MS.</i>]; it was, indeed, the most necessary for observance. But in order to relate the harm that follows from not observing it,
there should be another man who knows better how to say it than I do. This law or clause contains two parts. In the first
is stated the obligation of the governor in allotting the Indians; in the second, the obligations of the encomenderos toward
their encomiendas. As for the first, it might (and not without reason) be disputed whether, for your Majesty&#8217;s peace of conscience
and for the welfare of these natives, it is fitting that these encomiendas be allotted. But since this subject requires more
time and space than I now have to devote thereto, let it remain for another voyage, when, by the help of God, these and other
doubts will be dissipated, for the service of God and your Majesty. I venture to say this because, although your Majesty has
so near you so many and so excellent learned men in all subjects, yet, to determine many matters relative to the Yndias, it
is doubtless necessary to have dwelt in them, and that for not a few years. For the present it is sufficient to say that if
the governors (before allotting the Indians) and the encomenderos (after their allotment) would observe even what is demanded
from them in this clause, they would relieve your Majesty from painful scruples, and us from doubt, and thus from a heavy
burden of conscience; while to the Indians would be given an extraordinary benefit. But all is contrary to this, because neither
do the governors, when allotting the Indians, take notice of what is here required from them&#8212;for they make the encomiendas
<a id="d0e6062"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6062">221</a>]</span>before the Indians are pacified, or even have heard the name of God or of your Majesty&#8212;nor do the encomenderos heed the obligation
which they take upon themselves; but, confident of the encomienda allotted in this manner, they go to collect the tributes
in the manner above stated; and among them are some who do so even more tyrannically.

</p>
<p>145th. Of clause 145, that which has to do with the Indians is not observed any more than the foregoing in regard to reserving
the chief villages for your Majesty. Your islands are not like Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, where there is a chief village with many others
subject to it. Here all are small villages, and each one is its own head. The governors, interpreting this law more literally
than is good for the service of your Majesty, have added to your royal crown some very small maritime villages; and the advantage
has been given to whomsoever they have wished&#8212;whether justly or not, it is not for me to decide. I can assure your Majesty
that it is very little in way of tributes that finds its way into the royal chest, although there is much need that your Majesty
should have money here to provide many necessities, which others cannot supply if your Majesty cannot. I also say that, according
to accounts current here, no Indians are harder worked or less free than those apportioned to the royal crown. There are many
other reasons which might be given to make this clear, which are very patent to us here. One is that, as the officials do
not go out to collect the tributes, the governor sends one of his servants whom he wishes to favor, to collect them. He collects
for your Majesty what they owe, and for himself whatever he desires; and this is most certain, as well as the method of collecting.
<a id="d0e6066"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6066">222</a>]</span>Your Majesty&#8217;s Indians undergo greater oppression than do the others. Those encomenderos visit their Indians, and once in
a while they cannot help taking pity on them; but for those of your Majesty, there is no one to grieve and no one to care.
I even hear it said that many soldiers, when without food, take it from the Indians, under the pretense that they serve your
Majesty and are given nothing&#8212;saying that, as it belongs to your Majesty, they may do so.

</p>
<p>146th. What is contained in clause 146 is the thing which would most attract the Indians to receive our faith if it were observed.
But there is nothing which more impedes the conversion of these barbarians than that, from the very outset, the Spaniards
go among them and compel them to become subjects of another and a foreign king whom they do not know; and without more ado
demand tribute from them, which is the thing that they most unwillingly acquiesce in. Certainly it is a very great pity and
a cause for much grief that such covetousness is found among us, that&#8212;through not knowing how to deal with these barbarians,
through not having patience with them that they may understand the good which comes with us to them, and through greed for
what they now pay us&#8212;we may be the cause of thousands of them remaining unconverted, and of those who are converted becoming
so more through force than choice. I am certain that if this clause had been observed, all of these islands would be converted,
and that not as a pretense, but in all sincerity. From this your Majesty may see the harm done by those who do not observe
what your Majesty commands with respect to the pacification of the Indians. And&#8212;in order that you may know how these Indians
feel <a id="d0e6070"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6070">223</a>]</span>about paying the tribute&#8212;when my arrival was made known among them, and it was said that I was captain of the clergy, as the
governor was of the laymen, they asked if I had come to force on them any tribute, a thing which they so much fear. In the
instructions which the governor, Don Ger&oacute;nimo [<i>sc.</i> Gonzalo], recently gave to Captain Juan Pablo de Carri&oacute;n, who made the expedition to Cagayan, there is a clause stating that
&#8220;tribute shall not be demanded from them for one year&#8221;&#8212;which marks the beginning of some respect for your Majesty&#8217;s orders;
and I hope to God that it is to be one of much importance, in order that those Indians, who three or four times have been
so wronged and scandalized, may now have peace.

</p>
<p>147th. Clause 147 is quite forgotten, nor can those who govern be persuaded that this so holy manner of preaching the gospel
be tried; besides, your Majesty leaves no authority to the bishops or to other prelates to attempt the apostolic preaching
of the gospel, but all the authority is given to the governors, or is assumed by them. If this clause were to be observed,
the bishops and not the governors would have to reform whatever is needed. The preachers go either alone or with an escort;
hence it is that the governors attempt more than the conversion of the Indians. They never find place for the fulfilment of
this clause. It is without doubt a shameful thing, and unworthy of one who professes such a law as ours, that we should not
trust in God, for sometimes the preachers would do more alone, unaccompanied by arquebuses and pikes; and, although I do not
deny that this may be lawful and sometimes necessary, it would not be a bad plan that this be tried the other <a id="d0e6077"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6077">224</a>]</span>way, at some time. But it will not be done if your Majesty does not order otherwise.

</p>
<p>148th. It is very necessary to observe clause 148 in this country, since the Indians are thinly scattered, and are settled
amid rivers and marshes where they are found with much difficulty. Hence it is very desirable that the encomenderos do as
they are here commanded, and not wait for the religious or ecclesiastics, who can not do it with the same facility as can
the encomenderos. Moreover, since the removal of the Indians from their former homes is a thing very odious to them, and they
change their homes very unwillingly and with much hardship, it would be better that they be vexed with the encomendero than
with the minister&#8212;who has to teach them, and through whom they have to learn love, and who in all things strives for their
good. The same is true of building the churches and monasteries.


</p>
<p><i>Relation of what concerns the Sangleys</i>

</p>
<p>The commerce with the Sangleys has always been considered very important for the supplies and trade not only of this city,
but of those who come here to invest their money, and for what is expected from it in the future. For it might be that by
this means we shall get a foothold in that great realm, which of all things is so much desired. This trade has been so harassed
and injured this year that we are in great dread lest those who come here, or many of them, will not return, or that they
will not be willing to sell their merchandise at former prices, because of the bad treatment that they have received and the
lack of order here.

</p>
<p>During the past year and the present one the ill <a id="d0e6089"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6089">225</a>]</span>feeling has increased, because at first they paid nothing; but later anchorage dues were levied upon them&#8212;more by way of securing
acknowledgment than for gain; while last year and this they have demanded three per cent from the Sangleys, from which many
injuries to the latter have resulted. The first is, that they all were ordered to live apart, in one fenced-in dwelling made
this year, whither they have gone very unwillingly. There the shops have made them pay higher prices than goods would cost
them outside. A warden has been appointed for them, with judicial authority to punish them; and, according to report, many
wrongs and injuries are inflicted upon them. Indeed, for very trivial causes they are put in the stocks, and pecuniary fines
exacted from them. Sometimes they have been fined for going outside at night to ease the body, or for not keeping their place
clean.

</p>
<p>Under the pretext that they must pay taxes to your Majesty, a penalty was imposed upon the sale of any article without its
previous registration; but at the time of this registration the best of their merchandise was taken from them, and that at
the price which the inspector or the registrar chose to set. Some pieces of silk were therefore hidden by the Sangleys, either
to sell them to better advantage or to give them to persons to whom the goods had been promised. For this they were punished
with as much rigor as if the penalty had been required from them for many years, instead of being, on the contrary, only the
first or second time when they had heard of it. Among other things, I know that because a Chinese merchant <a id="d0e6093"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6093">226</a>]</span><span class="corr" title="Source: tenced">sentenced</span> him to one hundred lashes and a fine of seventy-five tost&oacute;ns. A brother of his came to me to ask protection for him, and
at my request they remitted the lashes; but he paid the tost&oacute;ns before he could leave the jail. Of these and of other wrongs
to individuals so many cases occur that I have been greatly troubled. For some would take the goods from the Sangleys by force,
and keep them; others would not give them what the goods were worth; others would give them written orders [Span. <i>&ccedil;&eacute;dulas</i>]<a id="d0e6100src" href="#d0e6100" class="noteref">8</a> (which are much in use among them), and afterward repudiate these. Thereupon they would hasten to me; and, as I could not
secure reparation for these wrongs, I was greatly afflicted. The confusion and lawlessness which prevailed in taking the goods
from them was so great, that in order to get these better and cheaper, those who had authority in this matter would not allow
the Sangleys liberty to sell to those whom they might prefer. But these of whom I speak took all the goods. Then, after having
selected what they desired, at whatever price they might choose, they would give the rest to their servants, friends, and
associates. In consequence, although twenty ships have come from China&#8212;and so many have never before been seen in this space
of time&#8212;nothing of all that comes from China has been visible this year. On the contrary, Chinese goods have risen to such
excessive prices that a piece of satin formerly worth ten or twelve tost&oacute;ns here, has been sold at forty or forty-five, and
yet could not be found, even for the church, which is so needy that it has not been able to obtain silk to make a single ornament.
<a id="d0e6106"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6106">227</a>]</span>The same is true of all other Chinese goods, which were formerly hawked in vain through the streets. Who may have been the
cause of this, what has become of these goods, or where they may have gone, it is not incumbent upon me to say. What devolves
upon me is, to represent to your Majesty the condition of this country, which can not last long volves upon me is, to represent
to your Majesty the will insist upon knowing whose is the guilt, and upon providing a remedy for your vassals who are so greatly
in need of it.

</p>
<p>From this condition of affairs has resulted very great harm, which must be the reason why the trade of this city has ceased.
That is, since all the goods have this year come into the possession of a few persons, the traders who came here on the strength
of reports of the good trade in this country have not spent their money; or else those who have spent it have bought very
little, and at so high prices that they will do well if they get back their money. The evil does not stop here; for these
traders are compelled to perform sentinel-duty, just as the soldiers do, and in order not to leave their goods to be stolen,
they pay a soldier who does this for them, and collects the money. Thus every week they have to pay one tost&oacute;n (the equivalent
of four reals) for the services of a sentinel.

</p>
<p>These same merchants were summoned for an expedition which was going to Iap&oacute;n [Japan], and a fleet was made ready to sail
thither; and in order to avoid going they paid as much as thirty and forty pesos each. Thus, in many ways, trade has been
unfortunate this year. The latest injury&#8212;that which most harassed the Chinese, and most succeeded in <a id="d0e6112"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6112">228</a>]</span>irritating them&#8212;was that, in sending a galley on the expedition to Iap&oacute;n which I mentioned, twenty or thirty Sangleys who
had come this year to remain here were seized, and compelled to row. Many have come to me to complain, saying that they had
come here to earn a living for their children; and asked that, since they were not allowed to accomplish what they came for,
they might be permitted to return to their own land. But it profited neither them nor me to say this, for they went on that
expedition and have not yet returned. From this another injury has come to us all. For since those who went in the galley,
and others sent afterward, were fishermen, the fish that formerly was sold in the streets in great quantities, and for a trifling
sum, now cannot be obtained at a high price. Next, they sent another vessel, loaded with rice as provision for the fleet,
and ordered a like number of Sangleys to accompany it. In order to avoid going, each hunted up whomsoever he could find; and
he who had no slave to send gave ten pesos to some other man to act as his substitute. These and other wrongs have caused
two hundred Sangleys, who came this year to settle here, to return; and of those who were living here two hundred and more
have gone away. There used to be a very prosperous settlement of them on the other side of the river, but now there appears
to be almost no one&#8212;as your Majesty will see by the letter written to me by the vicar of the Sangleys, who is an Augustinian
friar.
</p>
<hr><p>

</p>
<p>Another wrong is done to the Indians&#8212;not to all in general, but to many; it is, to hold them as slaves. This clause also concerns
the failure of the governors <a id="d0e6118"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6118">229</a>]</span>to obey your Majesty&#8217;s decrees and writs; for so many of these are issued, commanding that Indians must not be held as slaves
of the Spaniards anywhere in the Yndias&#8212;either in the islands or on the mainland, in lands discovered or to be discovered.
This applies, in whatever way the Spaniards may have obtained them: whether it be in just war; or if the Indians themselves
have sold them to the Spaniards, saying that they are slaves; or even if among them these are actually slaves; or by any other
means, and in any manner whatsoever. By the ship in which I came the Augustinian fathers brought a new decree from your Majesty,
ordering with much rigor, and in strong terms, that the Spaniards shall at once liberate the slaves whom they may hold, under
whatever circumstances they may have obtained them. This was presented to the governor, for I talked with him about it. But,
to show that what I say above is true&#8212;that no decree in favor of the Indians is ever enforced&#8212;since this decree was presented
the Indians are still in the same servitude as formerly, and some of them are even worse treated than in the past. The governor
did not so long delay to enforce the decree (if there be one) relative to taking a fifth of the gold; for the first thing
that he did on entering his office was to demand the fifth, while the decree regarding liberty is yet to be executed. I have
passed over many things in this connection which, if written here, would be annoying to your Majesty. A document in behalf
of the city is being prepared which proves the great necessity in this country for servitude. It states that the Spaniards
undergo much toil, and most of them many hardships, and that there is much need that your Majesty should aid and favor them;
but <a id="d0e6120"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6120">230</a>]</span>asks that this be done by allowing them to hold slaves. Your Majesty will order this to be carefully examined, for it is a
certain and well-established fact (and admitted by the very persons who hold and attempt to gain possession of slaves) that
although among the Indians there are some who are really slaves, these are few; and that, rather than sell these now, the
Indians will sell one of their children. All others are wrongfully obtained and unjustly enslaved&#8212;as would be done by a people
so barbarous as this, who at this very time sell a relative for gain, and among whom the more powerful will sell the weaker.
Most of those who today are in Manila as slaves are of this class. As soon as this decree was presented to him, the governor
asked me to advise him what he should do. Accordingly, I convened the superiors of the orders, and the religious therein who
had long resided here, with some very learned men who came with me. All of them, without one exception, were of one opinion,
a copy of which goes with this letter; your Majesty will please order it to be examined&#8212;although it profits little, because
proclamation of the decree and orders that it be obeyed were not issued until March of this year. Would to God that it had
not been proclaimed! because before that the masters were afraid, and had already determined to give their slaves liberty,
seeing that they were urged thereto in the confessional. But when the decree was proclaimed, and the petition which the city
referred to your Majesty was granted, all returned to their obstinacy. Upon seeing this, I again convened the fathers and
priests, and we agreed to admit the owner of slaves to confession, but on condition that they make no objection to what your
Majesty may order; <a id="d0e6122"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6122">231</a>]</span>or that within two years from the departure of this ship (the term assigned to them by your Majesty) they should free the
slaves. But I am sure that if your Majesty does not renew your order the masters would not release them, if two years or even
twenty should pass. It is a great hardship, and a scandal, to have to deny them confession; and many say that they will not
release their slaves until your Majesty so orders, even though they remain without confession. The decrees made by the city
and by the protector of the Indians are being sent to you. Your Majesty will order examination of them, and whatever else
may be proper, and command accordingly; because, although I have been of the opinion that for the present the masters may
be absolved, many of the religious refuse to do so unless the slaves are first given their liberty.

</p>
<p>It is next in order to inform your Majesty of what is done here with the prelates;<a id="d0e6126src" href="#d0e6126" class="noteref">9</a> it is as follows: When a Spaniard comes to this country he is at once ordered to serve under the flag, although he may be
a merchant who comes here to buy and sell. The authorities say that for the present it seems proper to allow the merchants
to depend upon their merchandise, and the encomenderos to live upon their encomiendas. All the rest live a very poor and wretched
life; for they are not supplied with any provisions, nor do they possess means to procure food and clothing. Notwithstanding
all this, they are ordered with great severity to assist the sentinels and aid in other duties of war, just as if they were
well paid. Hence ensue <a id="d0e6132"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6132">232</a>]</span>oppression and ill-treatment of the Indians; for sometimes when an Indian has some food that he has cooked for his own meal,
a soldier enters and takes it away from him. Not only that; they also maltreat and beat the Indians, and when I, being near
at hand, go to them and reprimand them for it, they say to me: &#8220;What is to be done? must we be left to die?&#8221; I assure your
Majesty that in this matter I suffer an intolerable torment; because all come to me with their troubles, and I have not the
means to remedy them. I only pity them, and do what I can, with my limited means, to aid them. Moreover, the encomenderos
refuse to pay tithes, although they have been ordered to do so; nor can the royal officials pay me what your Majesty orders
to be given me from your royal treasury, because they assert that no adequate instructions are sent them. Thus I am without
means for myself or for the poor. The former governors were accustomed to divide among the poor soldiers some of the rice
paid to your Majesty as tribute, in order that they might endure their misery; but now not even this is given to them. It
is a still greater oppression that the authorities neither consent to furnish them a living, nor give them permission to go
in search of it or even to leave this island. I gave to the governor the decree regarding this matter which your Majesty ordered
to be sent; but nothing has been done, because in it your Majesty did no more than to order him to attend to it, and to do
what he might think best.

</p>
<p>The governor consulted me about his intention to add to the tribute of the Indians two more reals apiece, with which to support
the poor soldiers; and I convened the fathers and the clergy to confer about <a id="d0e6136"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6136">233</a>]</span>this matter. Seeing that this country cannot be sustained unless there are Spaniards in it, unless the encomenderos are supported,
unless the tributes are collected with the aid and assistance of the soldiers here, and unless the Indians pay the tribute
which the encomenderos levy for love of the faith, they concluded that the encomenderos are obliged to support the soldiers,
who are necessary to render the country secure. But, on the other hand, they considered that as the encomenderos of these
islands are very poor, and some of them are married, and very few have encomiendas of reasonable extent, and they can maintain
themselves only with much difficulty&#8212;much less will they be able to support the soldiers. They concluded that your Majesty
is not obliged to use your royal patrimony for this and the other expenses, but that those for whose benefit they are incurred
(for which purpose the Spaniards are here) must bear the cost. Accordingly, if the tribute they give does not suffice for
all the expenses necessary in order that they may have suitable instruction and may be protected, they, and not your Majesty,
must bear these&#8212;as St. Paul says, and as the divine law commands. For this reason the governor wished to add the two reals
before mentioned, and there was no lack of agreement in this opinion among the fathers and clergy. To me also it seems that,
considering the divine law, these people are obliged to pay all the expenses. But considering the poverty of the common people,
that perhaps the tribute they give might suffice, for all that is necessary&#8212;if it were well apportioned&#8212;and for other reasons
that make the project doubtful, I have ventured to give the opinion that nothing should be added to the tribute which the
Indians now give, <a id="d0e6138"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6138">234</a>]</span>until your Majesty can be informed and can order what action should be taken.

</p>
<p>In these islands there are many soldiers who were married in Mexico, Espa&ntilde;a, and other countries. Many of them left their
wives twenty-five, others ten, fifteen, or twenty years ago; and others, more or less. I have done my best to induce them
to go to live with their wives, or to bring them here, but it has been of no avail. Will your Majesty please order that your
decree in this matter be observed, for this is not done&#8212;nor do the governors try to observe it, saying that the soldiers are
needed here; and thus they spend so many years, breaking the law of God and that of holy matrimony. I beg your Majesty, if
it please you, to provide a remedy for this; for, if your Majesty does not order it, there will be no one here who can send
them hence.

</p>
<p>The thing most necessary for the protection of these Indians until they shall better understand our ways is, that there should
be a protector who should look after them and defend them from the innumerable injuries that are inflicted upon them. The
governor has named one who, it appears to me, does this well, and with care and diligence. But as his appointment is temporary,
he dare not exercise his office with as much freedom as if he were appointed by your Majesty. I beseech your Majesty to order
this matter disposed of in such manner that it may be to the advantage and not to the injury of the Indians&#8212;which would result
if this office were given through favor or sale, instead of being conferred on a person who is unencumbered, and very zealous
in the service of your Majesty and for the welfare of the Indians; of such there will be very few. He who is now protector
<a id="d0e6144"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6144">235</a>]</span>is very persevering, and is qualified for this appointment. His name is Benito de Mendiola.<a id="d0e6146src" href="#d0e6146" class="noteref">10</a> But this man might prove deficient; and for the future, if it shall please your Majesty&#8212;since this should be well done (for
it surely is a very important matter), and the bishops are, by right, fathers of the unhappy&#8212;it might be entrusted to him
whom the bishop appoints, your Majesty naming the salary or requiring that it be raised here. If it please your Majesty, I
will see that the Indians pay it, which they will do very willingly. And if your Majesty does not commit this to the bishop,
he and the governor might be entrusted to name the appointee, it being provided that together and in no other way may they
remove him&#8212;because many times the protector has to ask things which the governor does not like. The governor becomes angry
at him, and if it is in his power, removes him&#8212;as I have seen done more than once since I came. The inhabitants of this city
are among the most loyal subjects that your Majesty has in all his islands; and the soldiers, although suffering so many hardships,
as above stated, and many more which cannot be told, are so obedient to orders in the service of your Majesty that it is certainly
a cause for thanksgiving to God that, in so great an expanse of country, there should be a prince so obeyed and feared, loved
and reverenced as is your Majesty in these regions. And since this condition of affairs is conserved by subjects perceiving
gratitude in their kings and princes, and knowing that their rulers reward them for loyalty, I humbly petition <a id="d0e6155"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6155">236</a>]</span>your Majesty to give attention to what I have said (which is unquestionably true); and that you show them favor, in order
that they may know that your Majesty is pleased with their loyalty.

</p>
<p>I understand that what they ask is, that your Majesty order that the limits of this city&#8217;s jurisdiction (which is five leagues)
be maintained; and that you make them a gift of some lands, of which they have none, but without which no commonwealth can
be sustained or conserved. The cabildo of M&eacute;xico has, besides other sources of income, an encomienda&#8212;that of Jalapa, a prosperous
village near M&eacute;xico. Here there is at present nothing with which to undertake any enterprise, unless your Majesty is pleased
that some village be given them as an encomienda, in order that from the tributes may be obtained means to defray the necessary
expenses, and conduct the public business in such manner as your Majesty shall order. With that they will be well content.
The governor despatched a soldier to Maluco to ascertain what conclusion the Portuguese of those islands had reached. He returned
almost at the same time as the ship from Nueba Espa&ntilde;a, with the news which the governor will write to your Majesty. This news
gave great satisfaction to all the people of these islands, because your Majesty&#8217;s interests are thereby promoted, since our
Lord has placed in your Majesty&#8217;s hands the spice-trade of Maluco, which your ancestors so greatly desired. I am sending the
letter which the captain at Maluco wrote me, in order that it may please your Majesty to reward generously so worthy a Portuguese
as this man is&#8212;who certainly has displayed great zeal in your Majesty&#8217;s service&#8212;not forgetting him who obtained and bore the
news. <a id="d0e6159"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6159">237</a>]</span>This is Ensign Francisco de Due&ntilde;as, a very intelligent man, and very reliable in his own duties, who by his energy and diligence
succeeded with this undertaking, in which others had failed. He is an old soldier in these islands, and has served your Majesty
well in times of war. He is loved by all in this city, and has a good reputation on account of his excellent qualities. He
is a person to whom anything whatever may be entrusted; he is very faithful, and a very good Christian. Will your Majesty
please order that some reward be given to him? because he merits it, and because others may thereby be encouraged. I also
beg that the Portuguese soldiers of Maluco may be in some way rewarded for the affection with which they ask your Majesty
to be their king and lord.

</p>
<p>In the letter written to me by the captain, he complains that I have not written to him; and he has reason for this&#8212;although
the blame was not mine; for the governor wrote to the captain without saying anything to me, as he has done in other undertakings.
I do not say this to speak ill of the governor, but only that your Majesty may know how affairs go here, and what respect
is paid to the bishops.

</p>
<p>In regard to Maluco, your Majesty will send some one there who understands it well. To those here who understand the trade,
it has appeared that the cloves and other spices will go at less cost by way of Nueba Espa&ntilde;a, and with less risk and more
quickly than by way of India; and that to preserve the supply of cloves, so that it may not be destroyed, it is necessary
that your Majesty should not permit the Indians of those islands to be allotted, but should retain them under your Majesty&#8217;s
direct control, and they should be dealt with as the king of Portugal dealt with <a id="d0e6165"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6165">238</a>]</span>them. For if the Spaniards try to subjugate them, and order them to pay tribute, all will be lost&#8212;especially in view of the
ill-treatment which the Castilians will inflict upon the natives if the conquered land be given to them as an encomienda (even
though it be with name of pacification), as we have seen them do in all lands where they have been. The Indians would receive
such harm at the first entrance of the Spaniards that it would not be repaired in many years. Your Majesty will pardon my
boldness and accept my desire, which is very strong, to serve your Majesty, in stating what I and many conscientious persons
here feel. Your Majesty will adjust the matter as shall serve your interests.

</p>
<p>It is now three years since certain Franciscan religious left this island to go to China (as your Majesty will already know),
without notifying the governor. Now they have determined to do the same thing; the custodian, whose name is Fray Pablo de
Jes&uacute;s, has gone thither with his companions, without saying anything to the governor, for which I am very sorry. For lack
of their labors here, many Indians who were already Christians have remained without instruction, which I consider a great
disadvantage. But, knowing that God moves the hearts of men (a matter that we cannot understand), I will overlook that. The
governor took this with more asperity than I wished, for he sent after them, and the person who went thither treated them
very rudely; but finally God ordained that they should arrive at this island. The governor ordered a proclamation to be made
(its contents will be seen by the copy of the ordinance which I send to your Majesty), which even to me seems very harsh toward
an order of so high character <a id="d0e6169"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6169">239</a>]</span>and strict obedience as is that of the discalced Franciscans. I advised the governor not to act with so much severity, but
he did not see fit to grant my petition. I have since learned that the same person who went after them treated them very harshly
in Pangasin&aacute;n and Yllocos&#8212;perpetrating upon them many acts of oppression, taking away their ship, and refusing to let any
one accompany them&#8212;which occasioned no little scandal to the Indians. Among other reasons which the religious have given me
to justify their departure from here is the sight of the ill-usage which the natives of these islands receive from the Spaniards,
especially those who have the charge of justice; and they say that all these are for hindrance, and no one for help. Hence
no harvest can be gathered; and therefore they went to seek a place where they could gather it. Certainly they are not far
wrong, for the things that occur here and the obstacles opposed by those who ought to aid us, are so numerous that many times
I have longed to leave it all and flee to the mountains; but the charge that I hold keeps me within bounds. There is very
little respect for the ministers of the gospel; and they cannot exercise their office without being dependent upon those who
have more concern for their own profit than for the instruction of the Indians.

</p>
<p>There was sent to the island of Macan, where the Portuguese live&#8212;near the city of Canton, in China&#8212;a father of the Society,
and with him two Franciscan religious, to deal with the Portuguese there, in the same way as with those at Maluco; he was
sent also to the Chinese governor at Canton. A copy of the letter is sent to you, in order that it may be seen what is asked
from the Chinese governor and in what <a id="d0e6173"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6173">240</a>]</span>form; for the Chinese who were then here told me how it should be properly written; they said that their governor would thus
learn our usages, and that he would be delighted if we would write to him as we write to one another.

</p>
<p>To fulfil our obligation, and to bring this narrative&#8212;already so long&#8212;to a close, I will not omit, as your Majesty&#8217;s servant
and chaplain, to say that since these lands are your Majesty&#8217;s, and you have in them so many and so loyal and obedient subjects,
both Spaniards and Indians, you should please to see that the people are cared for and well treated; and that the governors
preserve their liberties, and do not convert the government into a source of profit to those who govern, as has been done
heretofore, to the great injury and deterioration of these colonies.

</p>
<p>To remedy this condition, your Majesty should send to govern them not those who solicit that charge, but those whom your Majesty
shall seek&#8212;Christian men, without greed; for such men are what the people desire, and would suit them and us. Let your Majesty
send hither a man who comes alone, and without obligations to relatives or friends (in serving whom they neglect their duty
to the early comers, whose blood has been spilled), who is content with the salary that your Majesty assigns him (which is
always quite sufficient), and who hopes for advancement by your Majesty through his services; and who will not, by making
himself rich in two years, destroy this country, or prevent others from enjoying it and gaining a livelihood. By doing this,
your Majesty will have one of the best possessions in the Yndias. But if things go on as heretofore and there is no one to
attend to it, it cannot continue long. If it shall <a id="d0e6179"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6179">241</a>]</span>please your Majesty to entrust the government to men who live here, there are those who could conduct it very well and creditably,
without the many disadvantages which attend those who come from Espa&ntilde;a.

</p>
<p>The foregoing is such information as I can give your Majesty from here regarding the transgression and observance of the royal
commands, laws, and decrees; and of the present state of this country, the wrongs that occur in it, and what matters ought
to be remedied. On account of the little time before the ship departs, not all of this letter is so polished as to be fit
to appear before your Majesty. If this relation is deficient (as it cannot fail to be) it is not in lack of truth or in desire
to serve your Majesty and secure the welfare of these souls whom, because of their sins and my own, I have in charge. If there
is anything which to your Majesty appears worthy of remedy, I humbly ask for it; and if I have said anything about which it
appears to your Majesty I ought to have been silent, I also humbly beg that I may be pardoned. Since your Majesty knows that
I am five thousand leagues distant from your court, and surrounded by so many griefs and afflictions, you will not be surprised
at what I say, but at what I leave unsaid&#8212;and even why I myself did not go to beg for the remedy; for it certainly is a different
thing to see and endure it here, than to hear it mentioned there.

<h2>Instructions to Commissary of the Inquisition</h2>
<p><i>Instructions which the person who is or in future will be the commissary of the Holy Office in the city and bishopric of Manila
and the Phelipinas Islands of the West,<a id="d0e6194src" href="#d0e6194" class="noteref">1</a> must mark and observe, in order better to fulfil the office and trust which he holds.</i>


</p>
<p>1. For this office shall always be chosen persons who are thoroughly competent and well approved&#8212;whose purity of family descent,
and exemplary life and habits, have been previously ascertained through written information. Besides this, confidence is placed
in their prudence, moderation, and temperance, which qualities will enable them to exercise aright the trust conferred upon
them, and they will exercise it, for the public good, for the better transaction of business, and not for any private ends.
Above all, it behooves them, and they are earnestly charged, not to employ the name and title of the Holy Office for avenging
individual wrongs, or for the intimidation <a id="d0e6206"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6206">243</a>]</span>or affront of any person. The more such a person shall suspect the inquisitor&#8217;s friendship, the more prudently must the latter
deal with him; otherwise, not only will God be therein offended, but the Holy Office will be greatly wronged.

</p>
<p>2. As soon as the commissary receives his appointment, and before he makes use of his powers, he must accept it in the presence
of an apostolic notary or a royal scrivener, in whose presence he shall give oath of secrecy and fidelity according to the
minute accompanying these instructions. He will show the said title to the governor, and to the ecclesiastical and lay cabildos,
in order that they may receive, treat, and recognize him as a commissary and agent of so holy an office. He will take great
care not to exceed his commission, but to fulfil it, observing these instructions and other particulars which will be sent
to him, which treat of the manner of receiving acknowledgments, substantiating testimony, and visiting ships. To show the
certificate of appointment to the cabildos is only a mark of courtesy, and in no way a necessary proceeding; for there is
no need of their permission or approbation. The commissary is advised of this because the patent for his commission does not
require any other contrasignature or permission for its validity.

</p>
<p>3. Secrecy is the surest means, which the Inquisition is to employ very rigorously, for the detection and punishment of crimes.
Therefore the commissary is strictly charged to observe secrecy in reference to these instructions, or any others which shall
be sent to him, or letters written to him about business, and all else that comes to his notice in the capacity of commissary.
He shall impose the same secrecy upon <a id="d0e6212"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6212">244</a>]</span>all those who act as accusers or witnesses, or who ratify their former testimony, and upon all honest persons who are present
at such ratification&#8212;ordering all the said parties to observe secrecy, under pain of excommunication, and under the obligation
of the oath which they took when making their depositions. The commissary, moreover, shall impose other punishments, pecuniary
or corporal; and shall enlarge on the gravity of the sin committed in the disclosure of a secret by a witness, with this warning,
that the Inquisition punishes from the standpoint of example, and according to the character of the person and the nature
of the transaction. On account of the great distance, [to Manila]<a id="d0e6214src" href="#d0e6214" class="noteref">2</a> it is fitting to make this <a id="d0e6247"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6247">245</a>]</span>provision, that whenever any person who shall incur excommunication for having disclosed a secret shall come, of his own free
will, to ask for absolution, therefore with the confession of his guilt the commissary shall absolve him, and impose upon
him some secret spiritual penance, such as will entail no stigma or infamy. The commissary shall submit his own denunciation
to the Holy Office, without making further investigations concerning the matter except in serious cases. But should the disclosure
of a secret result in any marked injury or bring dishonor to a person, in such an event further information is required, in
order that in either case the Holy Office may, after due examination, justly dispose of the matter as is fitting, although
no change will result for the absolved person.

</p>
<p>4. Special care must be taken to warn bishops, vicars-general [<i>provisores</i>], visitors, and vicars, that they are not allowed to mention crimes of heresy or the like in their public letters and proclamations
during visit; for his Holiness has referred and submitted such cases to the most illustrious inquisitor-general and the inquisitors
appointed by him in all the kingdoms and seigniories of his Majesty. Therefore they shall try these cases <i>privatim</i>, which other judges can neither try, nor undertake to investigate, nor otherwise handle. Since in visitations crimes often
come to light which must be tried by the Holy Office, warning must be given that these should be submitted to the Inquisition,
with all secrecy and without the knowledge of the guilty party. The same must be done in suppressing the titles of vicars,
in annulling the head of processes and charges made by the bishops, and in suppressing the title of inquisitor-inordinary;
<a id="d0e6257"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6257">246</a>]</span>for in these regions the jurisdiction over the crime of heresy is wholly apostolic, except in case of the Indians. If any
doubt, contention, or difficulty regarding the execution of this clause should arise, the commissary, without further inquiry,
shall promptly notify us that he has warned, in especially polite and respectful language, the prelate concerned, to whom
he must show much reverence&#8212;for the reverential respect which is due him should not be in the least abated by the privilege
of the commissary&#8217;s office.

</p>
<p>5. It sometimes happens that certain ecclesiastical or lay judges take up matters belonging to the Holy Office, and make judicial
inquiries therein. The question whether they should forbear from investigation of such cases, and submit them to others, has
caused differences to arise between them and the commissaries, and has made them set forth most weighty arguments. Since the
main care shall be to prevent such clash of authorities, in order to avoid this it is enough to bid them not to meddle in
such matters. But if they persist in doing so it will be necessary to send them an injunction, couched in very respectful
terms, drawn up in writing before a notary; to note their answers; and then to report everything to the Holy Office.

</p>
<p>6. In cases of disobedience, disrespect, hindrance, and obstruction to the free and just exercise of the Holy Office, which
also are wont to occur, the commissary shall be careful not to lose his temper, or to give way to words or deeds injurious
and offensive to any person; on the contrary, that is the time for him to control himself and show great moderation. He shall
make a diligent and full inquiry from other persons <a id="d0e6263"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6263">247</a>]</span>regarding the whole case, and shall notify us through his report; in this way any disobedience or disrespect on the part of
a judge or a private person will be punished with greater rigor and justification. The delay which is apparent in this case
might seem injurious, but it will not be so&#8212;as it is not in the transactions of the Inquisition; for, after men have slept
soundly, they are awakened by a very exemplary punishment.

</p>
<p>7. Denunciations regarding the matters contained in the edict shall be received in the commissary&#8217;s own house, in a suitable,
secret, and convenient place. They shall always be made by day, unless it should be necessary to receive them by night. The
persons who come for this purpose must be treated with kindness, each according to his station in life. Every sort of infamy
upon the party concerned must be avoided as much as possible.

</p>
<p>8. In receiving denunciations there shall be no delay, but rather great care and diligence, as likewise in examining the evidence,
following and keeping within the bounds of the injunctions laid down in the instructions which are especially sent for that
purpose. The same and even greater care, and much attention, are required in forwarding depositions.

</p>
<p>9. Since it often happens that some of the witnesses are out of the city, and therefore depositions must be taken in different
places, let the case in question decide the course of procedure, whether or not the commissary shall order the witness to
appear before him. Usually there is no need to cause the witnesses the trouble of coming a long distance, when the investigation
can be entrusted to the parish priest [<i>cura</i>] or vicar of the place, the notary making certification <a id="d0e6274"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6274">248</a>]</span>at the head of the authorization therefor given to him by this clause. A case may arise where it is best to wait for the witness,
and it may be desirable to hold him, in order to examine him personally; this is left to the commissary&#8217;s choice, for, having
the case before him, he can decide what is best to do. If any one be summoned on the affairs of the Holy Office and shall
not render due obedience, a written order must be sent to him, imposing upon him the penalty of excommunication and a fine
in money, should he disobey. A report of all proceedings in each individual case shall be made, so that the disobedient person
may receive exemplary punishment, according to his station in life and the nature of his disobedience.

</p>
<p>10. Some are accustomed to send their denunciations through memorials, with or without their signatures, or by letters-missive;
but, since these persons write them under no pressure or oath, and without the presence of a judge or a notary, they expand
their accusations to the detriment of their neighbor&#8217;s reputation. Therefore the commissary ought to avoid as much as possible
the acceptance of such letters and memorials, and shall order the witnesses to declare under oath what they know of the matter,
in order to free their consciences, and shall examine them concerning the facts. If the acceptance of such a letter cannot
be avoided, the person who writes it should be summoned and made to acknowledge it under oath before a notary, after which
he should be examined about the letter. If the letter be written from a distant place, the rule in the preceding clause can
be followed.

</p>
<p>11. Likewise some persons, moved by passion <a id="d0e6280"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6280">249</a>]</span>more than by commendable zeal, are wont to denounce others on the ground that they are <i>confessos</i>, and therefore not entitled to wear silk, carry weapons, ride on horseback, or do other things forbidden to them by laws
and royal ordinances of these realms, as well as by the instructions of the Holy Office, as likewise is set forth in the edict.
In these cases one ought to be careful not to accept such depositions except from children and grand-children of <i>relaxados</i>, or from children of a relaxada,<a id="d0e6288src" href="#d0e6288" class="noteref">3</a> or from persons who themselves have been reconciled to the Church [<i>reconciliados</i>]. The commissary may receive denunciations from these three classes of persons, and send them to the Holy Office, without
making any arrest, issuing interdicts, or taking other steps. On the contrary he will maintain great secrecy, and charge the
witnesses to do the same. As for other persons denounced as confessos, since they are not in the said class, nothing will
be written. On the contrary, the same secrecy will be imposed upon the witnesses and they shall be very kindly admonished
to be silent, and not to slander their neighbors, informing them that the Holy Office will take no offense at what they have
testified.

</p>
<p>12. The heading of the charge made against any person must begin with the words of the first witness, and not, as is customary
with ordinary judges in these regions, the formula, that &#8220;it has come to his notice,&#8221; etc.&#8212;inserting first what he has heard
concerning the crime from any witness. When the commissary receives <a id="d0e6307"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6307">250</a>]</span>documents of many clauses from this Holy Office for the investigation of different matters and against many persons, he will
place as introduction to the inquiry that he makes in each case that clause of the document which applies to the matter in
question, legalized by the notary.

</p>
<p>13. Any arrest made by the Holy Office is a matter of much reproach and dishonor for that person, and of no less damage and
injury to his property; therefore an arrest should be made with prudence, care, and for just cause. Authority for this is
not given to the commissary, who neither should nor can arrest a person except in special cases, and by a special order entrusted
to him against the person who is to be arrested; and even then, the commissary must see that the purport of the said order
be executed, without exceeding it.

</p>
<p>14. The crime of bigamy is very frequent in this country, so that it behooves all commissaries to make diligent inquiry concerning
it, and to punish the crime. If the ecclesiastical or secular court arrest any one for this crime and proceed against him,
let them administer justice freely and without hindrance. If they refer the case to the commissary without charge, and without
his making any effort for such remission, the latter shall say that it is very well, and that they may refer and send the
case to this Holy Office at their own expense&#8212;or at that of the prisoner, if he be well-to-do. If they still urge him to receive
the case there, that it may be sent by the order and at the expense of the Holy Office, the commissary shall answer that he
has no orders from us for such action. If, dissatisfied with this answer, they ask permission to inflict punishment there,
he will answer that they <a id="d0e6313"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6313">251</a>]</span>may investigate the matter, and may do justice according to law. After that he will allow no more arguments on the question.

</p>
<p>15. This clause applies when the said courts have anticipated the case by the arrest of the accused person; for if the latter
were free, and through information received from witnesses his two marriages were proved, and the existence of the first wife
at the time of the second marriage, which constitutes the crime, the commissary shall arrest and remand to prison the person
thus proved guilty&#8212;sending with the prisoner the information or original record, but retaining there an authenticated copy
of it. Concerning other cases of bigamy, which do not show the same degree of guilt, it will suffice to send authenticated
copies of such records or depositions as are received, and to keep the originals. Special information must be sent concerning
the prudence of the accused, his station in life, and his wealth; so that after due examination the necessary measures may
be taken. If he should come to this country [Mexico], the commissary must give us notice of his coming, so that the Holy Office
may hear of it by the first despatches which shall reach Mexico. He shall also write to the commissary who resides at the
port of Acapulco, that any attempted absence or flight may be prevented.

</p>
<p>16. Concerning the other crimes enumerated in the general edict, after the denunciation has been received and the witnesses
have been examined, according to the order laid down in the instructions, it will suffice to send such information without
making any arrest or taking other steps. The commissary shall also send information concerning the person&#8217;s birth-place, station
in life, means, and the real estate that <a id="d0e6319"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6319">252</a>]</span>he owns in this country, or in Espa&ntilde;a. He shall notify us, in case such person comes here, so that we may deal with him as
the nature of his offense demands.

</p>
<p>17. As for the judicial proceedings in matters which concern the Holy Office&#8212;whether they be settled, or informal, or pending
official transactions&#8212;which other courts submit to the Holy Office, whether at the instance of the attorney-general or by
agreement, all original documents must be delivered, without retaining a copy of any; oath to this effect will be made by
the apostolic notary or by the royal scrivener who hands them over. Since suits which do not belong to the Holy Office are
sometimes thus handed over, the commissary shall, on account of the danger that they may be lost at sea, not send documents
until he shall first examine them. If they clearly prove to be cases not belonging to the Inquisition, he shall return them
to the owners. In case of doubt, the commissary shall send an account of the offense, with the evidence, and the status of
the process&#8212;saying whether it is decided or pending, and whether informal or received on trial; he will also report as to
the rank of the accused person, and whether at the time any arrest has been made, or will be made in the future. Ordinarily,
whether the case be one of bigamy or of some other crime, the commissary shall proceed as stated in the two preceding clauses.
If he should not be sent as prisoner, it will not be right to do so until his offense be investigated here; accordingly the
commissary may discharge him under bail or under juratory security.<a id="d0e6323src" href="#d0e6323" class="noteref">4</a> <a id="d0e6326"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6326">253</a>]</span>If the accused is unable to provide security, the commissary shall command him not to leave the city, town, or province where
the crime occurred and where he owns property, under severe penalties of excommunication, and pecuniary or bodily punishments,
suitable to the person&#8217;s station. If such person wishes to come to this country, he can do so by offering the same bail or
security to the Holy Office; but he must first be warned not to make the journey if other matters render such a step unsuitable.
He shall be assured that in his absence his trial and his honor will receive the same attention as if he were present.

</p>
<p>18. When any arrest must be made according to these instructions, it must, for any case of bigamy, be made according to clause
fifteen. The commissary shall issue orders entrusting the matter, as is customary, to some one of the familiars whom he has
to keep in the city. Until he has familiars, for lack of them he shall entrust it to the person on whom he has most reliance,
and in whose integrity he most confides. When it is necessary, but only then, he may ask for the aid of the royal officials
of justice. Whenever this shall be necessary, the royal officials may seize only the person pointed out to them by the Holy
Office; and they must assist him, giving their favor and aid only for such person. In order to obtain this help, the commissary
needs only to ask for it in polite terms; and it may be demanded without the necessity of giving information, either written
or oral, regarding the offense&#8212;and, indeed, he shall be very careful not to do so. On the contrary, if anyone should be so
inconsiderate as to ask for such information, let the commissary send us a detailed account of what takes place in the matter.
<a id="d0e6330"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6330">254</a>]</span></p>
<p>19. Royal magistrates are under obligation to render this assistance, since the request therefor does not require from them
any fees, alguacil, or scrivener. The magistrates are also under obligation to receive and keep any prisoner in their jails,
to take good care of him, and to account for him, but without exacting therefor any prison-fees. Accordingly the commissary
will, when occasion arises, notify the magistrates and request their assistance; and if necessary he will command it, under
pain of excommunication and a money fine. Thus he will not be obliged to find another and special prison, and incur the expense
of guards. If the rank of the person, and the condition of the prison, and the nature of the crime require a more special
and secret prison, on account of the danger that the prisoner may be able to communicate his affairs to other persons, such
arrangements are left to the judgment of the commissary, who is charged to see that in these arrests little outcry be made,
and that all scandal be avoided.

</p>
<p>20. When the criminal is arrested, the commissary shall send him by the first available ship, registering him as being in
the shipmaster&#8217;s charge&#8212;commanding the latter (under penalty, if necessary), to take good care of the prisoner until he shall
be handed over, at the port of Acapulco, to the commissary who dwells there, who is duly authorized to act. If the prisoner
be well-to-do, the commissary shall send at least one hundred pesos&#8217; worth of his property, in order to pay for the food that
he needs during his imprisonment, and to meet the expenses that he may incur during the journey; otherwise, the commissary
shall send whatever sum be may obtain from the property. Since these men who are twice <a id="d0e6335"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6335">255</a>]</span>married are not a very dangerous class of people, the commissary may in a case of flight exercise leniency, by allowing them
to come and present themselves under a sufficient security, corresponding to their station and means.

</p>
<p>21. A sequestration of property is very injurious to a person, especially in the Indias, where all the value of property depends
upon its management. The commissary ought not therefore, in any case, to do this; on the contrary, the arrested person shall
permit suitable provision for his property, according to his own preference, entrusting it by means of an inventory to some
person in whom he has confidence. The latter shall bind himself, in due form, to be the depositary of such goods as the prisoner
may leave in his charge on account of his arrest; and in such manner that it may not seem to be a deposit or a sequestration
by the Holy Office, but simply a contract between two parties. This accomplished, the commissary shall obtain very minute
information about the station of the prisoner, his mode of life, and the means and property that he may possess. If he has
any reason to suspect that either the prisoner or the person to whom he has entrusted his property on account of the arrest,
is endeavoring to hide, or squander, or alienate the property, he shall be careful not to allow such alienation or any other
mismanagement of the property; until the Holy Office, having examined his offense, shall make suitable provision for a legal
sequestration: for in punishing a crime, the property of the guilty person is always regarded as an accessory element, to
be used in behalf of the person to whom it shall belong after the culprit is released from prison.
<a id="d0e6339"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6339">256</a>]</span></p>
<p>22. Money for the prisoner&#8217;s food, for the expenses of his journey, according to his station, and for his bedding and clothes,
must be taken entirely from his estates; and if he has none, let such of his goods be sold as will inflict least damage upon
him, to the amount necessary, at a public auction before a notary or a royal scrivener. No officer or agent of the Holy Office
shall take anything from the said sale, either personally or through agents&#8212;a command which is general in all cases when goods
are sold by the Holy Office, whether they are sequestrated or not. To better ascertain which of the goods would cause him
least damage, it will be advisable to consult the opinion and desire of the interested party.

</p>
<p>23. All that has been said thus far concerning the acceptance of denunciations, and the reference of cases, prisoners, and
proceedings to the Holy Office, does not apply to the Indians&#8212;against whom the commissary shall not proceed for the present,
but shall leave them to the jurisdiction of the ordinary.<a id="d0e6344src" href="#d0e6344" class="noteref">5</a> Cases involving them are not to be referred to us. All other cases, in which mestizos, mulattoes, and Spaniards, of all classes,
are involved, shall be tried exclusively by the Holy Office rather than by the ordinary courts, as specified in the fourth
clause of these instructions.

</p>
<p>24. The Holy Office is wont to issue edicts&#8212;as, for instance, the general edict concerning matters of the faith, and other
specific ones&#8212;for the prohibition and seizure of certain books. The public reading of these edicts is of the utmost importance,
having the force of a notarial summons. It always takes place <a id="d0e6349"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6349">257</a>]</span>in the cathedral church, where the people are commanded several days beforehand to meet, under pain of excommunication. The
sermon is assigned to the most learned preacher of reputation and authority, who preaches it elsewhere, on that same day;
notice is therefore given to the monasteries and to all concerned. The Holy Office shall appoint both the preacher and the
day, although it is best to make arrangements therefor with the prelate, and obtain his concurrence; for in so doing nothing
is detracted from what is due to the Holy Office. Although the penalty of excommunication is imposed, it is not held to bind
any except those who for petty considerations neglect to heed it. In denouncing their guilt the commissary shall absolve them,
imposing upon them only some secret spiritual penances and not any pecuniary or ignominious punishment. Others who through
carelessness, negligence, or ignorance, fail to appear, the commissary shall discharge with a gentle reprimand, setting at
ease their consciences in regard to the excommunication.

</p>
<p>25. The Inquisitor therein anticipating the action of any other judge is accustomed to visit all ships which arrive at the
ports, no matter whence they come; therefore the commissary shall do so, if he is in a place where it can be done, and shall
ask the principal officers of the ship the questions sent with these instructions. If he is unable to do so in person, he
will entrust the matter to the parish priest or the vicar who resides in the port, sending him a copy of the questions to
be asked. He will notify us as to the ports chiefly frequented by ships, where it will be best to keep persons with a special
commission from us; and will name some of the persons to whom this commission <a id="d0e6353"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6353">258</a>]</span>may be given. When the commissary has succeeded in visiting the ship at its station in the harbor, the captain, master, or
clerk, or some of the passengers will find it necessary to go ashore, to the city; then, while the supplies most needed are
being procured, he will examine them. In all this it is very important to avoid carelessness. This is understood only of ships
which belong to Spaniards and come from Nueva Spa&ntilde;a, Piru, or Panama, or from Portuguese India, or from other regions.

</p>
<p>26. One of the most important reasons for inspecting the ships is the books, especially the boxes which come as cargo. The
royal officials and magistrates of his Majesty who reside in the ports shall send the said boxes to the commissary of the
Inquisition, without opening them or taking any books out of them. The commissary shall open them and examine the books, comparing
them with the general catalogue; and after seizing such as he finds are prohibited, he will give the rest to the owners To
this end the commissary shall make known to the royal officials of the city, and to those who reside in the ports, the ordinance
which accompanies this paper; and this applies even when the said boxes of books have been previously examined by another
inquisitor.

</p>
<p>27. Whenever a ship departs from the islands, the commissary must send replies to the letters which are written to him, and
information of what is occurring there.

</p>
<p>28. Finally, we recommend the examination of these instructions&#8212;which, although so full in their provision for all contingencies,
properly apply to ordinary occurrences, with a few clauses for which <a id="d0e6361"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6361">259</a>]</span>provision had already been made. The most difficult task, therefore, will be to examine them carefully at first, and to bear
in mind that any doubtful cases are to be decided by the commissary as shall be necessary, since he is so far away [from Mexico].
With this, and the confidence that we place in him personally and in his prudence and great zeal, we trust that the commissary
will meet all success.

<h2>Foundation of the Audiencia of Manila</h2>
<p>Don Phelipe, by the grace of God, king of Castile, of Leon, of Aragon, of the two Sicilias, of Ihm, of Portugal, of Navarra,
of Granada, of Toledo, of Valencia, of Galicia, of Mallorcas, of Sevilla, of Cerde&ntilde;a, of Cordoba, of Corcega, of Murcia, of
Jaen, of the Algarves, of Alge&ccedil;ira, of Gibraltar, of the islands of Canaria, of the eastern and western Yndias islands, and
the Tierra Firme of the great ocean; archduke of Austria; duke of Bergo&ntilde;a, of Brabante, and Milan; count of Absburg, of Flandes,
of Tirol, and of Barcelona; lord of Vizcaya and of Molina; etc. Whereas, in the interests of good government and the administration
of our justice, we have accorded the establishment in the city of Manila of the island of Lu&ccedil;on of one of our royal audiencias
and chancillerias,<a id="d0e6387src" href="#d0e6387" class="noteref">1</a> in which there shall be a president, three auditors, a fiscal, and the necessary officials; and whereas we have granted that
this Audiencia shall have the same authority and preeminence as each <a id="d0e6393"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6393">261</a>]</span>one of our royal audiencias which sit in the town of Valladolid and the city of Granada of these our realms, and the other
audiencias in our Yndias: now therefore we order to be made and sent to the said island our royal seal, with which are to
be sealed our decisions which are made and issued by the said president and auditors in the said Audiencia. Moreover, as to
the course of procedure which they are to follow in the performance of their duties, we have ordered certain rules to be drawn
up, as follows:


</p>
<p><i>House of Audiencia</i>

</p>
<p>1. First, we ordain and command that in the said city of Manila there shall be a house of Audiencia, where may sit and reside
our said president and auditors, and where our royal seal and register may be kept, and in which shall be the prison and its
warden, and the smelter for precious metals. If there should, however, be no accommodation for living in the said house, the
auditors shall lodge in other houses, which they shall occupy with the consent of their owners, paying them rent; and the
Audiencia shall be held in the house where the president dwells, and therein shall be the prison and its warden.

</p>
<p>2. It is our will and desire that the said Audiencia shall have as its district the said island of Lu&ccedil;on and the other Filipinas
islands of the archipelago of China, and the mainland of the same, whether discovered or yet to be discovered.


</p>
<p><i>Jurisdiction of the President and Auditors in Civil and Criminal Cases</i>

</p>
<p>3. We ordain and command that our aforesaid <a id="d0e6409"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6409">262</a>]</span>auditors shall have jurisdiction of all the civil and criminal cases which come to our said Audiencia on appeal from the governors,
alcaldes-mayor, and other magistrates of the provinces and islands and district subject to our aforesaid Audiencia, and shall
try them by examination and review, but shall not have jurisdiction of any case in the first instance&#8212;except it be in cases
which belong to a superior court<a id="d0e6411src" href="#d0e6411" class="noteref">2</a> or criminal cases which arise in the city, town, or towns where they may sit, or within five leagues thereof; and in the
civil cases arising in the town or village where they may sit, the alcaldes-in-ordinary shall have jurisdiction.

</p>
<p>4. <i>Item</i>: We ordain that our said judges try such civil and criminal cases in the same manner in which they would be tried by the
judges and alcaldes of our audiencias of Valladolid and Granada, and that they may and shall render decisions according to
the precedents of the alcaldes of our audiencias of Valladolid and Granada.

</p>
<p>5. <i>Item</i>: We command that the governors, alcaldes-mayor, and other magistrates of the said district shall authorize appeals to be
made from them to our aforesaid Audiencia in the cases in which rightly and in conformity with these rules it may have jurisdiction,
except those which must go to the councils for settlement in conformity with the decree made by us, and excepting further
the cases involving less than a certain sum in which by special decrees appeals from the alcaldes-in-ordinary must go before
<a id="d0e6429"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6429">263</a>]</span>the governors&#8212;which cases we wish to remain as they are during our pleasure.

</p>
<p>6. <i>Item</i>: In the civil cases in which judgments are pronounced after examination and review by our said president and auditors, they
are to be executed without any further appeal or petition, or other recourse, except when the case involves so large an amount
that there may be ground for a further appeal to our royal person, in conformity with the provision and decree of our laws
and ordinances. In such cases we desire that the privilege of appeal be given, under the condition that the party who makes
a second appeal must and do present himself before us within a year after the original judgment has been communicated to his
attorney. Yet we desire and command that the judgment of revision be executed notwithstanding such second appeal, the party
in whose favor the judgment was rendered giving first sufficient and satisfactory bond that, if it shall be reversed, he will
restore everything which has been adjudged and given to him thereby, in conformity with the judgment which has been pronounced
by the persons appointed by us. We also ordain that the cases which shall come up on such second appeal must be presented
as original cases before our council of the Yndias, being left just as they were; but an official report of the entire case
is to be left in the possession of a clerk of the Audiencia before which it has been tried, and the parties must petition
for such appeals before the Audiencia itself. Yet if the judgment of revision which is pronounced in our said audiencias be
with regard to possession, we declare and order that no opportunity is to be given for such second appeal unless the judgment
of revision is <a id="d0e6436"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6436">264</a>]</span>carried out, although it be contrary to that of the original trial.

</p>
<p>7. <i>Item</i>: In the hearing and judging of said cases, either civil or criminal, the decision shall be whatever meets the approval of
the majority; and should they be equally divided, two or three of the judges shall choose, impartially and in whatever manner
may seem best to them, an advocate for the determination of the case upon which they have disagreed. The decision of the majority
must be executed, even if this majority consist of but two. If there be but two judges in the Audiencia, they are empowered
to try and determine all the said cases alone; if they can agree, their decision is valid, and in case of disagreement, they
shall choose judges in the manner above described. If at any time there should be but one judge in the Audiencia, he is empowered
alone to conduct the proceedings in all the said cases up to the point of rendering final decision. He may make investigations
and issue orders for arrest, and when the affair is submitted for final decision, he may choose an assistant judge satisfactory
to him. He is empowered to pursue this same course in cases of damage which cannot be repaired by definite sentence; and in
a civil case of two hundred pesos or less, he is empowered to conduct alone an original trial or an appeal, as he may also
do in criminal suits for slander.

</p>
<p>8. <i>Item</i>: We ordain and command with regard to civil cases appealed from the alcaldes-in-ordinary of the city where the Audiencia
may be, or from the other magistrates within five leagues thereof, that they may be appealed before the Audiencia; and if
the judgment given by the Audiencia in said cases be <a id="d0e6448"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6448">265</a>]</span>of two hundred pesos of the mines [<i>pesos de minas</i>] or less, it shall be executed as if it were granted after review, and there shall be no appeal therefrom, whether the said
judgment be in confirmation or in revocation.

</p>
<p>9. [Technical directions for procedure in a case on appeal when the appellant desires, after appeal, to add to the evidence
taken at the trial of first instance. Affidavits are presented on both sides before the judge of first instance, an interlocutory
decision is pronounced, time is allowed for filing objections, and the record of the second series of proceedings is added
to that of the first.]<a id="d0e6455src" href="#d0e6455" class="noteref">3</a>

</p>
<p>10. <i>Item</i>: Whoever shall bring before our Audiencia a case on appeal may appear before the clerk whom he chooses. The clerk before
whom he appears shall be required to notify our president and auditors of such appearance, that they may assign the case so
as to produce equality among the clerks; and the same shall be maintained among the suits begun in the first instance in our
said Audiencia.

</p>
<p>11. <i>Item</i>: We command that the judgments pronounced by our said president and auditors for the region beyond the five-league limit,
and writs of execution and other writs, shall be given in our name and with our title, royal seal, and record. Writs with
seal and record shall receive the fees which by our royal tariffs of fees for our Audiencia have been commanded for them.
The judgments pronounced for the region within the five-league limit shall <a id="d0e6468"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6468">266</a>]</span>follow the form of orders without seal or record, issued by our auditors, etc. And these writs shall be obeyed and executed
in the same manner as writs and judgments sealed with our name and royal seal.

</p>
<p>12. <i>Item</i>: Our president shall keep a record of votes, which he shall swear to keep secret, and in which he shall enter, in brief form,
the opinions of himself and the auditors in all cases involving a hundred thousand maravedis and upwards.

</p>
<p>13. <i>Item</i>: We will that our auditors repeal no sentence of banishment, nor allow writs of delay for debts; yet we permit them to issue
writs of delay for six months to particular persons, and not in general&#8212;provided first that such person for legitimate causes
which have intervened is unable to pay; and that he offers approved security, not clerical or noble,<a id="d0e6480src" href="#d0e6480" class="noteref">4</a> that at the end of six months he will pay the debt. This term may be allowed for the same debt only once.

</p>
<p>14. <i>Item</i>: We ordain that the appeals taken from decisions for plaintiff or defendant in pecuniary suits, and in suits involving only
private interests, when said decisions are pronounced by those who report to the governors and corregidors of the district
of our said Audiencia, shall go before it; but as for all other matters heard by such judges, and as for the results of secret
investigation, they shall go before our council of the Yndias.

</p>
<p>15. <i>Item</i>: Our Audiencia shall appoint no judge in cases of residencia [<i>juez de residencia</i>], or governors for the provinces subject to their jurisdiction, or judges for special criminal investigations [<i>pesquisidores</i>]. If any individual bring complaint or <a id="d0e6502"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6502">267</a>]</span>charges against the governor, and the Audiencia shall see that the matter is of such nature that it is of importance to know
the truth concerning it, in such case they shall send one person to obtain the necessary information. The complainant or accuser
must give bonds that he will pay the costs and the penalty which will be assessed against him in case the accusation proves
false. In other cases special judges of investigation shall not make inquisitions, except with regard to riots and seditious
associations, or other matters of so pressing importance that the delay requisite for consulting us would produce notable
inconvenience.

</p>
<p>16. In cases which occur outside of the five-league limit, our president and auditors may appoint judges by commission [<i>jue&ccedil;es de comision</i>], to hear the cases and to administer justice with regard to them. Care must be taken that they make their inquiries in cases
which warrant inquiry, and in no others. Such judges by commission for crimes and misdemeanors shall be given authority only
to carry on a legal inquiry [<i>informacion</i>], and to arrest the delinquents and convey them to the prison of the Audiencia. They may also collect their fees from those
who owe them. The clerks before whom the cases are carried on shall hand the records in their entirety to the clerks of the
Audiencia, where the matter shall be completed in such manner that the parties shall be obliged to pay only single fees. And
if the clerks who attend such commissions have no commissioners [<i>receptores</i>], they shall be appointed by our Audiencia, and not by the clerks thereof.

</p>
<p>17. <i>Item</i>: We command that the receiving of the testimony which must be taken in the transactions which proceed from our Audiencia
shall be entrusted <a id="d0e6520"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6520">268</a>]</span>to the clerks of those cities where it shall need to be done. If there are no such clerks, our said Audiencia in the interim
during which there are no official commissioners of examination [<i>receptores</i>]<a id="d0e6525src" href="#d0e6525" class="noteref">5</a> shall appoint therefor a suitable person.

</p>
<p>18. <i>Item</i>: Our auditors in the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction shall receive no fees, or fines, or amercements, or anything
under color of charges for sitting as assessors to the judges. The fines which they lay in cases where the law assigns any
fine to the judge shall be for our exchequer and treasury, and for no other person. If the auditors take any of the aforesaid
payments, they shall restore them fourfold.

</p>
<p>19. <i>Item</i>: We command that when any governors, alcaldes-mayor, or other magistrates of the district of our said Audiencia, shall fail
to execute the writs and decrees which in our name the Audiencia shall send them, without showing that they have just cause
to desist from the execution thereof, then in such case the Audiencia may send officials whose fees shall be at the cost of
those guilty of disobedience, which officials shall cause the process of the Audiencia to be executed, notwithstanding the
provision that the Audiencia shall not send out special judges of investigation [<i>pesquisidores</i>].

</p>
<p>20. <i>Item</i>: Our Audiencia shall maintain those who have letters-patent of nobility or privileges of gentility in the said letters-patent
and privileges. In other cases where claims of gentle birth are put forward, they shall not try them, but remit them to the
<a id="d0e6549"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6549">269</a>]</span>audiencias of these kingdoms which have jurisdiction in such matters.

</p>

</p>
<p>22. <i>Item</i>: We ordain and command that all criminal cases which shall come for judgment, from all parts of their jurisdiction, before
our said Audiencia, of whatsoever nature or importance they may be, shall be tried, decided, and determined as on examination

process of appeal, petition, or any other legal remedy or recourse.

</p>
<p>23. <i>Item</i>: We ordain that no one shall appear at the prison of our Audiencia as an attorney, even though he have special power of attorney
therefor, unless he have information that his client is confined in the prison, and shall swear that the judge who shall be
trying the case is distrusted by him with just cause. In such case our auditors shall direct the judge to send them a signed
transcript of the record, in order that, after the transcript has been submitted, if it shall appear that they should try
the case, they may direct the transfer of the record to the Audiencia. In such case they shall grant the party a writ forbidding
the judge to proceed further with the case; and the prisoner shall appear at his own expense, providing good security. Before
the auditors have examined the record, they shall grant no writ of injunction, temporary or perpetual. If, however, the prisoner
shall have appeared in person, and shall find that he has a right to a trial in the Audiencia, and to <a id="d0e6566"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6566">270</a>]</span>a writ of injunction against the judge who claims the right to try the case of to summon the parties to appear to the charges,
let them give the writ. Meanwhile the prisoner shall be confined in the prison, and shall not be admitted to bail until by

cases.

</p>
<p>24. <i>Item</i>: We ordain and command that our president and auditors and the ordinary magistrates of our said Yndias, where there shall

and begun to try it. Likewise, our said president and auditors, with respect to the mints in their jurisdiction, may appoint
a person to report to the alcaldes and officials of the said mints.

</p>
<p>25. <i>Item</i>: We command that on Saturday of every week two auditors in rotation, as the president shall assign them, shall inspect the

He who is absent without sending a sufficient excuse
shall be fined half his pay for that day, by the person whom the president shall appoint, whose report in the matter shall
receive faith and credit, so that no auditor shall hold or try the said cases in his own house without being joined with all
the others, as has been said with regard to the said Audiencia, to hear and determine pleas and matters brought before it.

</p>
<p>27. <i>Item</i>: No auditor shall sit when a suit is begun that will affect him, his sons, fathers, sons-in-law, or brothers, or when he

own, of their wives, or of their children. The said suits shall be tried by the alcaldes-in-ordinary, and shall come on appeal
before our council of the Yndias if the case involves a thousand pesos or upwards. If the other party to the suit desires
to appeal to our Audiencia and not to the council, he may do so; but the auditor, his wife, and his children shall have no
such right of choice.

</p>
<p>29. Further: The said auditors shall not appear for others in the said Audiencia or in any other, nor shall they undertake
to arbitrate cases that may come before them, except that cases already begun may be submitted to all the auditors of the
Audiencia for arbitration, and except where our permission may be given&#8212;under penalty of being suspended from the <a id="d0e6606"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6606">272</a>]</span>Audiencia for thirty days and losing salary for two months.

other person, who shall have been interested in a suit within a year previous, or who shall expect to be so interested, and
the same as to their wives and children&#8212;under the penalty for forswearing, besides loss of office, being rendered incapable
of holding any other office, and being required to pay double for what they have taken. They shall take great care not to
converse much or be very familiar with advocates or attorneys who are pleading cases.

</p>
<p>31. <i>Item</i>: We command that our president and auditors shall not be engaged in military expeditions, or expeditions of discovery, without
my express command. They shall have no income-bearing estates [<i>granjerias</i>] either in cattle or in arable land, or in mines. They shall carry on no mercantile business by themselves, or in partnership,

<p>32. <i>Item</i>: There shall be appointed to no position as corregidor or other officer of justice the son, brother, father-in-law, son-in-law,
or brother-in-law of any president, auditor, or fiscal of our audiencias; and if any one shall be so appointed he shall not
perform the duties of the office, under a penalty of a thousand pesos of gold for our treasury.

<p>33. <i>Item</i>: We command that when any person desires to bring any suit or action against any of our auditors he may do so before our
said Audiencia, or before the alcaldes-in-ordinary, and he may appeal from the said alcaldes to the said Audiencia.

</p>
<p>34. <i>Item</i>: We ordain that when any auditor is offered as a witness the Audiencia shall appoint a magistrate, in order that the rights
of the parties may not be lost for want of evidence; and they shall give direction that he is to give his testimony, unless
it shall appear that he is offered as a witness maliciously to prevent him from acting as judge in the case.

</p>
<p>35. <i>Item</i>: We command that an auditor who goes on a tour of inspection shall receive no more fees than are ordained and commanded to
be given him, and shall accept nothing from Indians or Spaniards except food, on penalty of repaying it fourfold.

the alcaldes-in-ordinary, notwithstanding the ordinance to the contrary.

of government, the Audiencia itself shall assume the government and do all that he had authority to do&#8212;the senior auditor
filling the office of president, and taking charge of the other matters committed to the president until we make provision
in some other manner.

</p>
<p>38. <i>Item</i>: We command that our said president shall not have authority to give permission to the auditors of the said Audiencia to
come to these realms without our express command.

<p><i>Affairs of government</i>

</p>
<p>39. <i>Item</i>: We command that in our said Audiencia there shall be a record for affairs of government, in which our auditors shall register

report, attested by his signature, of the salaries, payments, fees, and allowances paid in this territory from our royal treasury
to all persons whatsoever, and shall state how much was paid to each, and for what reason. And he shall give a list of the
corregidorships, stating in it to whom the appointment is given by our warrant [<i>cedula</i>], and to whom by order of our president and Audiencia, and for what reason; and he shall report on the qualifications and
merits of each person, the amount of fees that each one receives, the amount of salaries in each corregidor&#8217;s district, and
the persons appointed in each district, and their qualifications. He shall also state the nature of their service, and how
long it is since they were appointed to the said offices. The same reports shall be made by our fiscal and our officials of
the royal treasury.

</p>
<p>41. <i>Item</i>: We desire that one of our auditors, each in his turn, shall make a visit of inspection once a year to the villages of the
district of the said Audiencia, and to the inns and, apothecaries&#8217; shops, seeing to it that the inns shall have fixed lists
of rates. The medicines and other things in the apothecaries&#8217; shops which he discovers to be spoiled he shall pour out and
not permit to be sold. On the same visit to the provinces of his district he shall inform himself <a id="d0e6677"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6677">275</a>]</span>as to the nature of the soil, the amount of the population, and the best means of supporting the churches and monasteries
required. He shall observe what public buildings arc needed for the good of the towns and the better traveling of the roads.
He shall find out whether the natives perform the sacrifices and commit the idolatries to which they are accustomed, how the
corregidors perform their duties, and whether the slaves that go to the mines are instructed in doctrine as they ought to
be. He shall ascertain whether the Indians support themselves, or whether they are made slaves, contrary to that which is
ordained. And he shall inform himself in a compendious manner with regard to everything else requiring his attention. The
said auditor shall have warrant to attend to matters in which delay would be dangerous, or which are of such a nature that
they do not require greater deliberation. He shall remit to the Audiencia the other cases to which he is not obliged to attend.
For the acts aforesaid shall be given to the auditor the warrant of the decree dealing with inspections.

</p>
<p>42. <i>Item</i>: We command that our said president shall grant no fee, office, corregidorship, or other source of profit by which means
of support may be gained, to any man who has Indians in encomiendas.

of infamy, and the other penalties incurred by vassals disobedient to their king and lord.

</p>
<p>45. <i>Item</i>: Any person who desires to petition us for any favor for services not performed in our Yndias shall first make his declaration
before the Audiencia in whose district he may be, and the Audiencia shall make an official report of the services performed,
and of his character. This report, folded and sealed, with their opinion at the foot thereof, shall be sent in duplicate to
our council, without being shown to the person interested. And if the person interested desires to make a report for himself,
they shall receive and transmit it.

</p>
<p>46. <i>Item</i>: We command that in each and every case when any towns or individuals of their district appear before our Audiencia to petition
for license to make repartimientos, the Audiencia shall grant the license which seems to them due, but only so far as concerns
suits pending before the said Audiencia, and for public works for which no other maintenance is provided, and for no other
purpose. The said license in the aforesaid cases shall be granted, if such towns have no endowments [<i>propios</i>].

</p>
<p>47. <i>Item</i>: When any one shall petition for an assignment of any town lots or agricultural lands in the city or town where our Audiencia
shall reside, then after conference in the cabildo, notice of the judgment of the cabildo shall be given to our president,
by means of two regidors deputed therefor. And when they have made their examination, that upon which the president together
with the two <a id="d0e6711"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6711">277</a>]</span>deputies shall determine, shall be carried out, being attested by all in the presence of the clerk of the cabildo, that he
may record it in the council-book. Petitions for assignments of lands and waters for machinery shall be presented before the
president, who shall transmit them to the said cabildo that they may confer thereon. They shall return them by a regidor,
who shall report their conclusions, so that after examination the president may determine that which is fitting.

</p>
<p>48. <i>Item</i>: Our said president and auditors shall cause to be made a record-book in which shall be entered the names of citizens of
this territory, the service performed by each one, and the reward received by him, either in money, by way of fees, or in
other ways, or by appointment, and to what offices. The said record shall be kept with great care, together with the record
of votes, so that when any person makes a statement of services before them they may report their opinions in his case.

</p>
<p>49. <i>Item</i>: We command that our Audiencia, at the end of the two months during which the two regidors appointed as inspectors of weights
and measures have served, shall receive from them an account of their service.

</p>
<p>50. <i>Item</i>: We command that our Audiencia shall have authority to order the execution of the ordinances made for the provinces under
their jurisdiction, after being filed by them, and during the time while they are being sent to us for confirmation.

</p>
<p>51. <i>Item</i>: That an auditor every year by turns, beginning with the most recently appointed, shall audit the accounts rendered by the
cabildo of the city where our Audiencia shall reside.
<a id="d0e6733"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6733">278</a>]</span></p>
<p>52. Further: When the president and auditors shall be about to allot the lands, waters, watering-places for cattle, and pastures
of any town, city, or village, among the persons who are to be settled therein, they shall do so with the counsel of the cabildos
thereof, taking into consideration that in such allotments the regidors shall be preferred, provided they have no other allotments
of arable lands or dwelling-lots. Let such allotments be made without prejudice to the Indians, retaining for them their arable
lands, gardens, and pastures, so that all shall be cared for.

</p>
<p>53. <i>Item</i>: We command that our president and auditors shall appoint no administrative or notarial official, or fill any other permanent

<p>55. <i>Item</i>: We command that our said Audiencia, governors, and other magistrates of their district <a id="d0e6770"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6770">279</a>]</span>shall ascertain and know if in those regions there are any persons who have letters of authorization or apostolic bulls to
take possession of the property left by the archbishops who may die in those regions, or of the vacant bishoprics. When it
is known who has them, let him cause them to be brought accordingly. First of all, let them appeal from such persons before
his Holiness, nor give nor allow opportunity for them to be used in any manner, nor for possession to be taken of the said
property or vacant bishoprics. They shall not do, or permit to be done, any other acts in prejudice of the rights and usages
with regard to bishoprics to which we are entitled with respect to this matter, or in prejudice of the immemorial custom that
possession shall not be taken. And such authorizations and bulls thus obtained you will send in their entirety, in the first
ships, to be presented before the members of our Council of the Yndias, together with the appeals which shall have been taken
with regard to the matter.

</p>
<p>56. <i>Item</i>: When there shall be doubt with regard to the signification of anything in the contents of an ecclesiastical appointment,
or as to the requisite collation at the hands of the bishops of benefices for the clergy whom we present, let the president
of the Audiencia decide it.

</p>
<p>57. And when in our said Audiencia the aid of the secular arm is asked for by the prelates and ecclesiastical judges, let
them plead by way of petition and not of demand.

</p>
<p>58. <i>Item</i>: Our Audiencia and the other magistrates of our said district shall see to it that in the towns which are not populated by
Spaniards no bulls shall be published. They shall not permit Indians <a id="d0e6784"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6784">280</a>]</span>to be compelled to hear the preaching of them, or to receive them. Those which are published from the pulpit shall be published
in the Spanish language. We also give the same command to the commissaries of the holy crusade.<a id="d0e6786src" href="#d0e6786" class="noteref">7</a>


</p>
<p><i>Royal treasury and its officials</i>

</p>
<p>59. <i>Item</i>: We also ordain that the suits of our royal treasury be examined and decided before any others that shall be before the Audiencia;

</p>
<p>60. <i>Item</i>: Our president with two auditors at the beginning of each year shall audit the reports of the officials in charge of our
royal treasury for the previous year; and the said officials shall finish them within the months of January and February.
When they are completed they shall send a transcript thereof to our Council of the Yndias. We also command that at the end
of the said two months, if the said accounts are not completed, the officials of our royal treasury shall receive no salary

twenty-five thousand maravedis.

</p>
<p>61. <i>Item</i>: The judicial settlement [<i>remate</i>] made with regard to auctions by our royal treasury must not be made without the consent of the majority of those appointed
therefor, even when the auditor who shall be present desires it. Further, at such sales and settlements shall be present our
fiscal with <a id="d0e6814"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6814">281</a>]</span>said officials, who shall sell nothing in his absence.

</p>
<p>62. <i>Item</i>: We command that at the time when the auditing of the accounts of our royal exchequer by our president and auditors shall
begin, in conformity with the decree given thereon, they shall go first of all to our royal treasury and weigh and count the
gold and silver and the other things therein. They shall make a record thereof, and immediately begin the accounts; and when
they are completed the balance shall be collected within the time required by the said decree, and shall be placed in the
chest of the three keys, orders being given that the balance of the preceding year shall not be made up by the collections
received during the auditing of the accounts.

</p>
<p>63. <i>Item</i>: When the officials of our royal exchequer shall have need of absenting themselves from the city where they reside, they
shall not have authority to do so without license from our president, who shall give it for a short time, to a destination
within those regions, and no more. There shall be designated, in the place of the official on leave, a person suitable therefor
in the judgment of the said president. And if the said official absents himself in any other manner he shall lose his position.

<p>64. Further: At the time of the making up of the accounts of the tithes, for distribution according to the ecclesiastical
appointments, there shall be present thereat an auditor.

on the day before), after dinner, the senior auditor with our fiscal and the officials of our exchequer, and one of the clerks
thereof, shall discuss article by article the said suits and transactions by means of the said record, considering the state
in which they are and how the decisions reached at previous meetings have been carried out.

</p>
<p>67. <i>Item</i>: We command that our president and auditors shall have no authority to direct the payment of any money from our royal exchequer,
or to expend anything from it, without more express license and command&#8212;except when cases occur in which the delay required
to submit them to us for consultation would cause irreparable injury. In such case, when it shall seem advisable to our president
and auditors and the officials of our royal exchequer they shall expend therefrom that which they all jointly shall regard
as requisite, and shall make expenditures in no other manner. The warrant which they shall give for this shall be signed by
them all, on penalty that what is expended contrary to the tenor hereof shall be paid from their own property. They shall
immediately report the amount thereof, the purpose and manner of the expenditure, and the necessity for which it shall have
been made.


</p>
<p><i>Fines paid into the royal treasury</i>

</p>
<p>68. <i>Item</i>: We command that our treasurer shall receive all fines, in whatever manner they shall be applied by our auditors, whether
to our treasury, or to court rooms, or to other expenses. Our alguazil-mayor shall take charge of the enforcement of them.
<a id="d0e6857"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6857">283</a>]</span>The amounts so received by the said treasurer shall be immediately brought before the officials of our royal exchequer, who
shall deposit them in the chest of the three keys, and enter in a record everything thus collected from the said sentences.
They shall keep separate the fines for the treasury and those for court rooms; and our said president and auditors shall supervise
the care thereof taken by the treasurer, who shall at the end of each year, on account of the said sentences [<i>condenaciones</i>] and the receipt thereof, send to our Council of the Yndias a condensed report thereof, attested by his signature and that
of the officials, and a certificate from the clerks of the said Audiencia as to the sentences given.

</p>
<p>69. <i>Item</i>: There shall be in the possession of our president a record in which every clerk shall enter in his presence, every week,
the sentences passed in presence of the said clerk, on pain of being obliged to pay them from his own property. When the president
and auditors shall have need of anything, they shall give a warrant for it on our treasurer on account of those moneys collected
under judicial sentences passed for similar objects.


</p>
<p><i>Probate matters</i>

</p>
<p>70. Further: We command that our Audiencia shall audit the accounts of the administrators of the estates of deceased persons,
and shall see if they have observed the ordinances and decrees given with regard thereto. These accounts shall be audited
in the month of January, on pain of loss of salary for two months, to be taken from that due the first third of the year,
unless they show that they have audited the said accounts in the said month. We command <a id="d0e6873"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6873">284</a>]</span>further that, for the good administration of the estates of deceased persons, our said Audiencia shall appoint each year an

<p><i>Indians, and matters relating to them</i>

</p>
<p>71. <i>Item</i>: Our said president and auditors shall always take great care to be informed of the crimes and abuses which shall be committed,
or have been committed, against the Indians who shall be under our royal crown, or against those granted in encomiendas to
other persons by the governors or private persons. The said president and auditors shall make inquiry as to the manner in
which the ordinances and instructions given in regard to this matter have been and are observed, punishing the guilty with
all rigor, and providing means to bring it about that the said Indians shall be better treated and shall be instructed in
our holy Catholic faith, regarding them as our free vassals. This must be their chief care; it is that for which we have chiefly
to hold them accountable, and that in which they are chiefly called on to serve us.

</p>
<p>72. We command that our said president and auditors shall take great care to give no opportunity that, in the cases in which
Indians shall be plaintiffs or defendants, orders shall be granted on <i>ex parte</i> motions [<i>procesos ordinarios</i>] or that the suits shall be long continued without prompt decision. Our said auditors shall preserve the usages and customs
of the Indians when they are not plainly unjust, and shall take care that the same are preserved by the inferior judges.

</p>
<p>73. Let our said Audiencia and the bishop see to <a id="d0e6894"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6894">285</a>]</span>it that in every village there shall be a person appointed to give instruction in doctrine to the Indians and blacks who serve
without going into the field, every day one hour; and to those who go into the field, on Sundays and feast-days. And let the
Audiencia and the bishop compel their lord to bid them go and learn the doctrine.

</p>
<p>74. <i>Item</i>: Let no judge of first instance in the district o our said Audiencia meddle with depriving the caciques<a id="d0e6901src" href="#d0e6901" class="noteref">8</a> of their caciquedoms for accusations brought before the said judge, on pain of removal from office and a fine of fifty thousand
milreis to our treasury. Let the decision of the case in dispute be reserved for our Audiencia, for the auditor who shall
next inspect the said villages.

</p>
<p>75. <i>Item</i>: When a suit is brought against Indians, the plaintiff may make his complaint before our Audiencia, in whose district they
are; and an order shall there be given the parties that within three months, which may be extended to not more than six, each
one shall present his testimony. After the testimony of every twelve witnesses is taken, the report shall be sent, folded
and sealed, without other publication or formal conclusion of the preliminary proceedings, to our council, that it may decree
justice. And our auditors, before they send the record, shall cause the parties to be cited to come and appear before the
said council in pursuance of the said action, within the term assigned them, with warning that if they do not appear, the
case will be decided in their absence.
<a id="d0e6909"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e6909">286</a>]</span></p>
<p>76. <i>Item</i>: We command that when anyone by his own authority shall deprive another of the possession of the Indians whom he shall have,
our Audiencia, prohibiting the said violence and doing justice, shall restore matters to the state in which they were before
the act was done.

</p>
<p>77. <i>Item</i>: Let the president and auditors not permit any cacique or chief to come to this country from those regions without our license.

</p>
<p>78. Further: Our auditors, on two days in the week and Saturdays, if they have no suits of poor persons before them, shall
hear cases of Indians against Indians. We command that the auditor who shall go on a journey of inspection through the country
shall have power to try cases with regard to the liberty of the Indians, making report before the Audiencia. Likewise the
auditor who shall inspect the prison of the Indians shall examine the witnesses by personal examination, and not by report.

</p>
<p>79. <i>Item</i>: Our president and auditors shall appoint a judge to allot the waters to the natives for the period during which need thereof
may continue, whenever it may be necessary to do so, and no one shall be permitted to molest them therein. The said judge
shall come to the Audiencia to give an account of what he shall have done, and he must not come at the cost of the Indians.
Our said auditors shall take great care not to send a notary to take testimony [<i>receptor</i>] for light causes, to the Indians&#8217; villages or elsewhere, except in a matter of importance, and one in which there is great
advantage in sending them.


</p>
<p><i>Fiscal</i>

</p>

<h2>Bibliographical Data</h2>
<p>All the documents presented in this volume, except four, are obtained from the Archivo general de Indias at Sevilla, and are
translated from our transcriptions of the original MSS. They are located as follows:

</p>
<p>Pe&ntilde;alosa&#8217;s two letters: In the patronato &#8220;Simancas-Secular; Audiencia de Filipinas; cartas y expedientes del gobernador de Filipinas vistos en el Consejo; a&ntilde;os 1567
&aacute; 1599; est. 67, caj. 6, leg. 6.&#8221;

</p>
<p>Loarca&#8217;s &#8220;Relation:&#8221; In &#8220;Simancas-Filipinas; descubrimientos, descriptiones y poblaciones de las Yslas Filipinas; a&ntilde;os 1537 &aacute; 1565&#8212;1&deg; hay 2&deg;; est.
1, caj. 1, leg. 1|23.&#8221; In the Real Academia de Historia, Madrid, is a copy of this document, made by Mu&ntilde;oz; it is somewhat modernized in spelling, capitalization, etc. A copy of
Mu&ntilde;oz&#8217;s transcription is in Lenox Library. The original MS. is without date; but internal evidence with Pe&ntilde;alosa&#8217;s statement
in his letter to the king (<span class="smallcaps">Vol</span>. IV, p. 315), shows that Loarca wrote his account of the islands in June, 1582. In the same legajo with this document is
the &#8220;Report on offices saleable;&#8221; but, as the dates show, both are misplaced here. They probably belong in the same patronato
as that in which are found the next two documents.
<a id="d0e7390"></a><span class="pagenum">[<a href="#d0e7390">306</a>]</span></p>

preceding one, but covers the years 1582 to 1606. These two documents are in &#8220;est. 1, caj. 1, leg. 3|25&#8221;&#8212;the Audiencia decree
being also designated as &#8220;1&deg; 1, no. 11.&#8221;
